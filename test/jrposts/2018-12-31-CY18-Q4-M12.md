Bitcoin is a novel social and economic institution. It is so different from our existing institutions that we should be skeptical and ask as many hard, pressing questions as we can before trusting it with any economic value. Some answers will only reveal themselves with time (or [Lindy](https://medium.com/incerto/an-expert-called-lindy-fdb30f146eaf), as the cool kids say), but that doesn't mean we can't come up with theories or frameworks. One such framework that has helped me a lot in understanding bitcoin is social contract theory.

First, [fiat money is the result of a social contract](https://medium.com/swlh/why-bitcoin-3fdee2328759): The people give the state control over the supply and other vital functions of money. The state, in turn, uses that power to manage the economy, redistribute wealth, and fight crime. But many don't realize that bitcoin works through a social contract as well.

> The social layer and its rules are the heart of bitcoin.

And that social contract framework can be used to answer some essential questions: Why did bitcoin come into existence? Who decided its properties? Who controls it today? Can a critical bug kill bitcoin?

### Social Contract Theory

Social contract theory starts with a thought experiment: It assumes a hypothetical _state of nature_ full of violence, that is unbearable for people to live in. Driven by a desire to improve their situation, they come together and collectively agree to empower Leviathan, the sovereign government, to protect them. Each gives up some of their freedom (to, you know, steal, and murder and stuff) while the Leviathan is granted the power to create laws, enforce them, and protect the people from violence.

But the theory is not constrained to the relationship between the people and the state. We can apply the same thought experiment to economics. If enough people are unhappy with the barter economy, they can collectively agree to use money, credit, or something else to improve the quality of their trading.

The process of money or credit happens implicitly. Every person asks the question of what outcomes they prefer and how they can achieve them. If many people in a society want the same outcome, we can call the result a "Schelling point" or social contract.

### Money as a Social Contract

Throughout history, governments that controlled money have abused their power in all kinds of ways: They confiscated accounts, blocked certain people or groups from transacting, and printed more money and inflated the supply—sometimes to the point of hyperinflation.

Whenever governments crossed a line in abusing their power, the people lost trust in the social contract that granted the government this power. They returned to an agreement that preserved most of the benefits (having a common medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account) without the worst of problems (government abuse): a commodity money.

> Money presents an important lesson: The larger and more valuable a social institution gets, the more it attracts others to seek control over it.

The problem with the new commodity money contract, however, was that it turned out equally unstable. Let's take, for example, the gold standard. Physical gold was too inconvenient to divide, move, and store. So people quickly invented another layer on top of it and traded with representative paper money, while the physical gold no longer moved. Because paper money is easy to produce, there had to be a trusted central party to watch over the supply. From there it was a small step for governments to decouple the value of the paper money from the underlying commodity to establish fiat money once again.

Herein lies a valuable lesson: You can agree you're in a terrible situation and you can agree you want to change it, but the resulting social contract is only as strong as it is credible. Without a stable institution to enforce it, a contract loses the trust of the people and falls apart.

### The Rules of Bitcoin

When Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin, he did not invent a new social contract. Satoshi did something else—he leveraged technology to solve many problems of past implementations and implemented the old contract in a new and better way. He settled on [the following rules](https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo/status/1045697433374797824):

* Only the owner of a coin can produce the signature to spend it (confiscation resistance)
* Anyone can transact and store value in bitcoin without permission (censorship resistance)
* There will only be 21 million bitcoins, issued on a predictable schedule (inflation resistance)
* All users should be able to verify the rules of bitcoin (counterfeit resistance)

### Bitcoin as a New Form of Social Institution

Money presents an important lesson: The larger and more valuable a social institution gets, the more it attracts others to seek control over it. So the institution needs protection, which it can only get from that other powerful entity: the state. Over time, protection turns into control and then into abuse. When the social institution loses its benefit for the people, it is replaced by a new institution, and the cycle starts over again.

Satoshi attempted to break this vicious cycle in two ways: First, instead of getting its security from a powerful central party (like a government), bitcoin creates a hypercompetitive market for its own protection. It turns security into a commodity and the security providers (miners) into toothless commodity producers. And, second, Satoshi found a way for these competing security providers to come to consensus over who owns what at any given time.

The bitcoin protocol automates the contract agreed upon on the social layer, while the social layer determines the rules of bitcoin, based on the consensus of its users. They are symbiotic: Neither of them would be sufficient without the other. The social layer and its rules are the heart of bitcoin. But the protocol layer makes them enforceable for the first time, while simultaneously making the social contract more credible to outsiders.
![The social contract](/assets/images/cy18/cy19q4m12/hasu-3.png){: .align-center}
Seeing bitcoin as a social contract, enabled and automated by a technical layer, has many benefits. And it can help us answer the philosophical questions about bitcoin.

### Who Can Change the Rules of Bitcoin?

The rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously on the social layer. The bitcoin protocol implementation only automates them. Bitcoin, as a computer network, comes into existence when many people run bitcoin implementations on their computers that follow the same set of rules (think of them as speaking the same language).

You stay in the network as long as you follow the same set of rules as everyone else. If I were to change the rules of bitcoin unilaterally on my local computer, it would not affect the rest of the network—it only gets me evicted because we no longer understand each other (I now speak a different language).

The only way to change the rules of bitcoin is to propose a change to the social contract. Every such proposal has to be voluntarily accepted by other people in the network because it only becomes a rule if enough people actively include it in their local ruleset. Convincing millions of people is an incredible amount of (grassroots) work and practically rules out any contentious changes, which could never get broad social consensus. This is why the bitcoin network can be [upgraded in ways](https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f) that reflect the wish of its members but is at the same time incredibly resilient to changes from bad actors.

### Can a Software Bug Kill Bitcoin?

In September 2018, a software bug arose in the most popular implementation (local ruleset) of bitcoin. The bug had two potential attack vectors: It allowed an attacker to shut down other people's bitcoin clients (making it so they could no longer verify the rules, breaking the counterfeit resistance) and to potentially spend the same bitcoin twice (breaking the rule of inflation resistance).

Bitcoin developers quickly fixed the bug by providing the network an updated ruleset that closed these possible attack angles. While the bug was found in time and was never exploited by an attacker, it left some people asking: How much damage could it have done? Would the bitcoin network have to live with the inflation once it happened, effectively breaking the trust in that rule?

[Social contract theory](https://ledger.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/62/0) can answer that with a resounding "no." Bitcoin's rules are made on the social layer, and the software only automates it. Where the social contract and the protocol layer diverge, the [protocol layer is wrong](https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard/status/1042985747093962752)—always. A failure of the protocol layer to temporarily enforce the rules of the contract has no permanent bearing on the validity of the contract itself.

> The bitcoin token itself has no value. The value exists purely on the social layer.

Instead, here is what would have happened: The potential bug exploit would have been mended by reorganizing the blockchain in a way that undoes the damage done by the attacker. That would have split the bitcoin network into two networks, each having their own token: one with the bug and one without it. Every bitcoin owner would have an equal number of tokens in each network, but the value of these tokens would be exclusively determined by the market, i.e., how much the next person was willing to pay for them.

At this point, it's important to understand that the bitcoin token itself has no value; it's nothing more than a number in a ledger. The value exists purely on the social layer. Hence, it is also social consensus that decides which of the two tokens, going forward, would receive economic support. It's likely that all economic value would migrate to the new, mended network.

When the bitcoin software successfully automates the rules of the social contract, the two layers are synchronized. And when the software temporarily goes out of sync, it always has the social contract as a guiding beacon of light to return to. This most recent bug will not have been the last. Social contract theory gives us assurance that bugs can happen and don't threaten the social institution of bitcoin.

### Do Bitcoin Forks Endanger the No-Inflation Rule?

Another famous philosophical question centers around the concept of "forks." Since bitcoin's software is open-source (allowing users to verify that their ruleset does what it says), anyone can copy it and make changes. That is called "forking." But, as established earlier, these changes are only made to the protocol layer, not the social layer. Without changing rules on the social layer first, the only result from forking bitcoin is that you evict yourself from the network.

If you wanted to fork bitcoin—and not have the new network die immediately—you would have to fork the social contract first. You would need to convince as many people as possible that your ruleset is better for them, so they update their rules together with yours. These kinds of forks are scarce and hard to pull off because they require the buy-in of thousands of people. Using this process to create value is akin to running a presidential campaign as a financial investment.

Again, the key is in understanding that all value for tokens is purely a social construct. The tokens do not have any value; they receive their value from social consensus. Forking the protocol doesn't equal forking the social contract, so the new token is worthless by default. In the rare case that the social contract itself splits (like when bitcoin cash split off from bitcoin), you end up with two weaker social contracts—each agreed to by fewer people than the old one.

Money in general and Bitcoin in particular can be seen as social contracts between people in society. Bitcoin is not a new contract either; it's just a new implementation of a contract that can be traced back [hundreds of years](https://www.soundmoneydefense.org/sound-money-explained). In comparison to previous attempts, the bitcoin implementation is a dramatic improvement because it creates a hypercompetitive market for its own security. Bitcoin's social layer and the protocol layer are mutually reinforcing, and their relationship gives us insight into little-understood concepts like rule changes, forks, or protocol bugs.

In the [second part](https://medium.com/s/story/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9?source=friends_link&sk=27e8cf65d45c46ffae1466ce2ac31b48), we showed how Bitcoin is a novel social and economic institution. But the question remains: **Who is going to use it?** Is there a place for Bitcoin among other institutions, and if so, where is it? Is Bitcoin just a terribly inefficient competitor to PayPal and Visa, like the media wants you to believe, or something more?

To put Bitcoin on the map with other institutions, let us first understand why humanity built social institutions in the first place.

Humans don't scale. Sure, we can learn, but we can't upgrade our brains and bodies like we can upgrade the hard drives and processors in our computers and machines. In fact, our physical and mental capacities have remained virtually unchanged since we roamed the earth as hunter-gatherers. Instead, we scale [through cooperation](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html). All scientific breakthroughs, all increases in productivity and prosperity, can be traced back to our ability to cooperate with each other.

### Cooperation has a Scaling-Problem

But because our world is fundamentally uncertain, cooperation doesn't come easy for us. We spend massive amounts of efforts on predicting how other people are going to react to our actions, and if those actions could affect us negatively.

When we can't reliably predict the behavior of others, our lives become a prisoner's dilemma. Should we cooperate with someone else to hunt down a stag, or stick to a rabbit which we could hunt alone? How can we trust him not to hit us over the head with a club and steal the stag? The path for humanity to "scale" and prosper is to find a way to break these prisoner dilemmas and cooperate anyway.

Game theory gives us two solutions to the prisoner's dilemma. The first is to turn the one-time-game into a repeated (or "iterated") game. If you and your potential hunting partner meet again tomorrow, you are more likely to behave, as each of you has to worry about the other's retaliation. But such repeated social interactions — or experience — are only possible with a limited group of people at the same time, as proposed by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar.

[Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. It's proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group.

### Cooperation through Institutions

The second rule, which Dunbar alludes to, is to "tie our own hands" and restrict ourselves from taking negative options that could hurt others. One such way is by adopting a shared morality and making sure these rules are socially enforced. But for groups that exceed Dunbar's number, we need institutions.

The most basic of all institutions is a monopoly of violence. By empowering a specialized group of people to a focus on protecting your town, you can more easily engage in productive enterprises because you don't have to worry if you can protect the fruits of those enterprises. Establishing a strong and benevolent monopoly on violence also strengthens the shared morality and formalize it to a formal legal system. The rules become more credible, after all, if there is a party strong enough to overpower any individual and make sure no one is "above the law".

On the shoulders of the monopoly on violence and the legal system, rests the most important institution of all: the right to private property. A private property system, protected by the state, gives you the exclusive right to your own resources and to use them as you see fit. Research has found that prosperity and property rights [are inextricably linked](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/property-rights-key-economic-development).

### Property Rights

Having well-defined and strongly protected property rights is the basis for all higher institutions: Markets are match-making systems between buyers and sellers that allow for specialization and the division of labor, while money allows for the creation of accurate price signals to producers and consumers.

We need a monopoly on violence to have a legal system, and we need a legal system to have property rights. We need property rights to have markets and firms, and we need markets and firms to have capitalism. It is through the invention of new institutions, each building on the existing ones, that civilization advances. Here is a simplified image of the institutional stack:

![institutional stack](/assets/images/cy18/cy19q4m12/hasu-5.png){: .align-center}

By streamlining human interactions, social institutions break the prisoner's dilemma and have us worry less about being harmed by others. The resulting increase of mutual predictability allows us to extend our trust to strangers and enable cooperation beyond Dunbar's number.

### The Bitcoin Institution

If we see bitcoin as a novel institution, which rights does it unlock? Let's remember the rules of the [Bitcoin social contract](https://medium.com/s/story/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9): Anyone can use the bitcoin network without permission (no censorship) and only he who owns money can spend it (no confiscation). Further, there is no central party that can print more money ahead of schedule and steal purchasing power from others (no inflation). Finally, anyone can verify that the rules are being followed before they accept a payment (no counterfeiting).

Do these rules stand the test of reality? In his excellent paper "How Bitcoin functions as property law", Eric D. Chason [states that](https://scholarship.shu.edu/shlr/vol49/iss1/3/) "Satoshi Nakamoto has created a form of property that can exist without relying on the state, centralized authority, or traditional legal structures."

I will go one step further and say that the bitcoin network, and, by extension, its money token **enable the highest form of property rights of any socio-economic institution in the history of man.**

### A New Era in Property Rights

That is the key innovation of Bitcoin: **It detaches property rights from the legal system and the monopoly on violence.** For the first time, we can have property that does not rely on a local authority to enforce and protect. It is easy to conceal, defend, divide, move, and verify — all by yourself, granting you the highest level of personal sovereignty.

Property rights used to depend firmly on other layers of the social institution stack, specifically the monopoly on violence and the legal system. If the bottom of this stack is shaky, you cannot have strong property rights. But because Bitcoin stands entirely on its own, it can bring the highest level of property rights to anyone in the world, no matter the quality of their lower-level institutions, the government or legal system.

![institutional stack with bitcoin](/assets/images/cy18/cy19q4m12/hasu-6.png){: .align-center}

Bitcoin unlocks a different dimension of value. In the same way that boats unlocked transport over water, and airplanes through the air, Bitcoin unlocks a new, alternate layer to store and move value — as the first native digital asset. It is the ability to exist solely in that digital world, from which Bitcoin derives all of its properties. It cannot be attacked in the physical space the way that physical assets can.

The implications of this will only reveal themselves over time, but we can already speculate who bitcoin maybe be tremendously useful for:

1. Anyone living in places with weak local property rights
2. Anyone subject to discrimination from the existing financial system
3. Anyone living in places with a weak local currency, with high (risk of) inflation
4. Anyone looking to store or move meaningful amounts of value (the highest value requires the highest amount of security)

Using Bitcoin gives these people the ability to cooperate more effectively, increase their productivity and, as a result, their prosperity. It allows them to save money for the future, to build capital that can be invested in more productive enterprises and let them partake in global trade with others all around the world.

### Progress through Competition

Bitcoin can also benefit those who never use it. As a hedge against central bank error, it makes the global financial system more resilient. Ironically, it can also improve other monetary and property systems around the world. _What?_ Yes, that is the effect that competition has on a market. If you are a customer of Apple, you benefit from Samsung releasing a new phone, because it forces Apple to improve the quality of their product to stay competitive.

![competition stack](/assets/images/cy18/cy19q4m12/hasu-7.png){: .align-center}

As a result, we could witness a quality improvement in monetary and property systems, because bitcoin opened the door for competition and created a market. This also shapes our understanding of what Bitcoin is NOT: a competitor to VISA or PayPal. It competes with local governments, legal systems and property rights — the fundamental layers of the existing stack — not with the payment processors that sit on top of it.

Civilization scales through cooperation, but cooperation between strangers is inherently hard. Social institutions can solve this prisoner's dilemma and allow us to cooperate on a larger scale. At the bottom of the stack, we need a stable and benevolent monopoly on violence, to enforce the rules of the legal system and establish property rights. Until now, it was impossible to have strong property rights in places with a weak local government. Bitcoin does not depend on the existing system in any way and can give us the highest form of property rights, no matter who and where we are.

## What I've Learned From Bitcoin: Part I

Some questions have easy answers. "What have you learned from Bitcoin?" isn't one of them. After trying to answer this question in a short tweet, and failing miserably, I realized that the amount of things I've learned is far too numerous to answer quickly, if at all. I also realized that any set of answers to this question will be different for everyone — a reflection of the very personal journey through the wonderful world of crypto. Hence, the subtitle of this series is _What I've Learned From Bitcoin_, with which I want to acknowledge the inherent personal bias of answering a question like this.

I tried to group the teachings of Bitcoin by topics, resulting in three parts:

* **I: Philosophical Teachings of Bitcoin**
* II:[Economic Teachings of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@dergigi/economic-teachings-of-bitcoin-b2cc4f2cfa96)
* III:[Technological Teachings of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@dergigi/technological-teachings-of-bitcoin-20420b459417)

As hinted above, attempting to answer this question fully is a fool's errand, thus my answers will always be incomplete. I would like to lessen this shortcoming by inviting you, dear reader, to share your own answers to this question:

![arjun tweet](/assets/images/cy18/cy18q4m12/gigi-2.png){: .align-center}

Bitcoin is indeed a game disguised. It is akin to a trapdoor, a gateway to a different world. A world much stranger than I would have ever imagined it to be. A world which takes your assumptions and shatters them into a thousand tiny pieces, again and again. Stick around for long enough, and Bitcoin will completely change your worldview.

### Lesson 1: Immutability and change

Bitcoin is inherently hard to describe. It is a _new_ _thing_, and any attempt to draw a comparison to previous concepts — be it by calling it digital gold or the internet of money — is bound to fall short of the whole. Whatever your favorite analogy might be, two aspects of Bitcoin are absolutely essential: decentralization and immutability.

One way to think about Bitcoin is as an [automated social contract](https://medium.com/@hasufly/bitcoins-social-contract-1f8b05ee24a9). The software is just one piece of the puzzle, and hoping to change Bitcoin by changing the software is an exercise in futility. One would have to convince the rest of the network to adopt the changes, which is more a psychological effort than a software engineering one.

The following might sound absurd at first, like so many other things in this space, but I believe that it is profoundly true nonetheless: You won't change Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will change you.

> "Bitcoin will change us more than we will change it."
> —[Marty Bent](https://twitter.com/martybent)

It took me a long time to realize the profundity of this. Since Bitcoin is just software and all of it is open-source, you can simply change things at will, right? Wrong. _Very_ wrong. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin's creator knew this all too well.

> The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.
> [— Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611)

Many people have attempted to change Bitcoin's nature. So far all of them have failed. While there is an endless sea of forks and altcoins, the Bitcoin network still does its thing, just as it did when the first node went online. The altcoins won't matter in the long run. The forks will eventually starve to death. Bitcoin is what matters. As long as our fundamental understanding of mathematics and/or physics doesn't change, the Bitcoin honeybadger will continue to not care.

> "Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. [...] It can't be changed. It can't be argued with. It can't be tampered with. It can't be corrupted. It can't be stopped. [...] If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted. "
> —[Ralph Merkle](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf)

The heartbeat of the Bitcoin network will outlast all of ours.

Realizing the above changed me way more than the past blocks of the Bitcoin blockchain ever will. It changed my time preference, my understanding of economics, my political views, and so much more. Hell, it is even [changing people's diets](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne74nw/inside-the-world-of-the-bitcoin-carnivores). If all of this sounds crazy to you, you're in good company. All of this is crazy, and yet it is happening.

Bitcoin taught me that it won't change. I will.

### Lesson 2: The scarcity of scarcity

In general, the advance of technology seems to make things more abundant. More and more people are able to enjoy what previously have been luxurious goods. Soon, we will all live like kings. Most of us already do. As Peter Diamandis wrote in [Abundance](https://www.diamandis.com/abundance): "Technology is a resource-liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce the now abundant."

Bitcoin, an advanced technology in itself, breaks this trend and creates a new commodity which is truly scarce. Some even argue that it is one of the scarcest things in the universe. The supply can't be inflated, no matter how much effort one chooses to expend towards creating more.

> "Only two things are genuinely scarce: time and bitcoin."
> —[Saifedean Ammous](https://www.bayernlb.de/internet/media/de/ir/downloads_1/bayernlb_research/sonderpublikationen_1/bitcoin_munich_may_28.pdf)

Paradoxically, it does so by a mechanism of copying. Transactions are broadcast, blocks are propagated, the distributed ledger is — well, you guessed it — distributed. All of these are just fancy words for copying. Heck, Bitcoin even copies itself onto as many computers as it can, by incentivizing individual people to run full nodes and mine new blocks.

All of this duplication wonderfully works together in a concerted effort to produce scarcity.

In a time of abundance, Bitcoin taught me what real scarcity is.

### Lesson 3: An immaculate conception

Everyone loves a good origin story. The origin story of Bitcoin is a fascinating one, and the details of it are more important than one might think at first. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Was he one person or a group of people? Was he a she? Time-traveling alien, or advanced AI? Outlandish theories aside, we will probably never know. And this is important.

Satoshi chose to be anonymous. He planted the seed of Bitcoin. He stuck around for long enough to make sure the network won't die in its infancy. And then he vanished.

What might look like a weird anonymity stunt is actually crucial for a truly decentralized system. No centralized control. No centralized authority. No inventor. No-one to prosecute, torture, blackmail, or extort. An immaculate conception of technology.

> "One of the greatest things that Satoshi did was disappear."
> —[Jimmy Song](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/why-bitcoin-is-different-e17b813fd947)

Since the birth of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies were created. None of these clones share its origin story. If you want to supersede Bitcoin, you will have to transcend its origin story. In a war of ideas, narratives dictate survival.

> "Gold was first fashioned into jewelry and used for barter over 7,000 years ago. Gold's captivating gleam led to it being considered a gift from the gods."
> —[Gold: The Extraordinary Metal](https://www.muenzeoesterreich.at/eng/discover/for-investors/gold-the-extraordinary-metal)

Like gold in ancient times, Bitcoin might be considered a gift from the gods. Unlike gold, Bitcoins origins are all too human. And this time, we know who the gods of development and maintenance are: people all over the world, anonymous or not.

Bitcoin taught me that narratives are important.

### Lesson 4: The problem of identity

Nic Carter, in an homage to Thomas Nagel's treatment of the same question [in regards to a bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_it_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F), wrote an excellent piece which discusses the following question: [What is it like to be a bitcoin?](https://medium.com/s/story/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bitcoin-56109f3e6753) He brilliantly shows that open, public blockchains in general, and Bitcoin in particular, suffer from the same conundrum as the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus): which Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin?

> "Consider just how little persistence Bitcoin's components have. The entire codebase has been reworked, altered, and expanded such that it barely resembles its original version. [...] The registry of who owns what, the ledger itself, is virtually the only persistent trait of the network [...]
> To be considered truly leaderless, you must surrender the easy solution of having an entity that can designate one chain as the legitimate one."
> —[Nic Carter](https://medium.com/s/story/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bitcoin-56109f3e6753)

It seems like the advancement of technology keeps forcing us to take these philosophical questions seriously. Sooner or later, self-driving cars will be faced with real-world versions of the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), forcing them to make ethical decisions about whose lives do matter and whose do not.

Cryptocurrencies, especially since the first contentious hard-fork, force us to think about and agree upon the metaphysics of identity. Interestingly, the two biggest examples we have so far have lead to two different answers. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split into two camps. The market decided that the unaltered chain is the original Bitcoin. One year earlier, on October 25, 2016, Ethereum split into two camps. The market decided that the _altered_ chain is the original Ethereum.

If properly decentralized, the questions posed by the _Ship of Theseus_ will have to be answered in perpetuity for as long as these networks of value-transfer exist.

Bitcoin taught me that decentralization contradicts identity.

### Lesson 5: Replication and locality

Quantum mechanics aside, locality is a non-issue in the physical world. The question _"Where is X?"_ can be answered in a meaningful way, no matter if X is a person or an object. In the digital world, the question of _where_ is already a tricky one, but not impossible to answer. Where are your emails, really? A bad answer would be "the cloud", which is just someone else's computer. Still, if you wanted to track down every storage device which has your emails on it you could, in theory, locate them.

With bitcoin, the question of "where" is _really_ tricky. Where, exactly, are your bitcoins?

> "I opened my eyes, looked around, and asked the inevitable, the traditional, the lamentably hackneyed postoperative question: 'Where am l?'"
> —[Daniel Dennett](https://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/Dennett-WhereAmI.pdf)

The problem is twofold: First, the distributed ledger is distributed by full replication, meaning the ledger is everywhere. Second, there are no bitcoins. Not only physically, but _technically_.

Bitcoin keeps track of a set of unspent transaction outputs, without ever having to refer to an entity which represents a bitcoin. The existence of a bitcoin is inferred by looking at the set of unspent transaction outputs and calling every entry with a 100 million base units a bitcoin.

> "Where is it, at this moment, in transit? [...] First, there are no bitcoins. There just aren't. They don't exist. There are ledger entries in a ledger that's shared [...] They don't exist in any physical location. The ledger exists in every physical location, essentially. Geography doesn't make sense here — it is not going to help you figuring out your policy here."
> —[Peter Van Valkenburgh](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/coin-centers-peter-van-valkenburg-on-preserving-the-freedom-to-innovate-with-public-blockchains)

So, what do you actually own when you say _"I have a bitcoin"_ if there are no bitcoins? Well, remember all these strange words which you were forced to write down by the wallet you used? Turns out these magic words are what you own: [a magic spell](https://medium.com/@dergigi/the-magic-dust-of-cryptography-c8ecd79ae13a) which can be used to add some entries to the public ledger — the keys to "move" some bitcoins. This is why, for all intents and purposes, your private keys _are_ your bitcoins. If you think I'm making all of this up feel free to send me your private keys.

Bitcoin taught me that locality is a tricky business.

### Lesson 6: The power of free speech

Bitcoin is an idea. An idea which, in its current form, is the manifestation of a machinery purely powered by text. Every aspect of Bitcoin is text: The whitepaper is text. The software which is run by its nodes is text. The ledger is text. Transactions are text. Public and private keys are text. Every aspect of Bitcoin is text, and thus equivalent to speech.

> "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
> — First Amendment to the United States Constitution

Although the final battle of the [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars) has not been fought yet, it will be very difficult to criminalize an idea, let alone an idea which is based on the exchange of text messages. Every time a government tries to outlaw text or speech, we slip down a path of absurdity which inevitably leads to abominations like [illegal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_number) and [illegal primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).

As long as there is a part of the world where speech is free as in _freedom_, Bitcoin is unstoppable.

> "There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be _text._It is _all_ _text_, all the time. [...]
> Bitcoin is **text.**Bitcoin is **speech.**It cannot be regulated in a free country like the USA with guaranteed inalienable rights and a First Amendment that explicitly excludes the act of publishing from government oversight."
> —[Beautyon](https://hackernoon.com/why-america-cant-regulate-bitcoin-8c77cee8d794)

Bitcoin taught me that in a free society, free speech and free software are unstoppable.

### Lesson 7: The limits of knowledge

Getting into Bitcoin is a humbling experience. I thought that I knew things. I thought that I was educated. I thought that I knew my computer science, at the very least. I studied it for years, so I have to know everything about digital signatures, hashes, encryption, operational security, and networks, right?

Wrong.

Learning all the fundamentals which make Bitcoin work is hard. Understanding all of them deeply is borderline impossible.

> "No one has found the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole."
> —[Jameson Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1061415918616698881)

My list of books to read keeps expanding way quicker than I could possibly read them. The list of papers and articles to read is virtually endless. There are more podcasts on all of these topics than I could ever listen to. It truly is humbling. Further, Bitcoin is evolving and it's almost impossible to stay up-to-date with the accelerating rate of innovation. The dust of the first layer hasn't even settled yet, and people have already built the second layer and are working on the third.

Bitcoin taught me that I know very little about almost anything. It taught me that this rabbit hole is bottomless.

### Conclusion

Bitcoin is a child of the internet. Even though it requires computers to function efficiently, computer science is not sufficient to understand it. The implications of this new technology are far-reaching. Bitcoin is not only borderless but also boundaryless in respect to academic disciplines.

In this first part of the _Teachings of Bitcoin_ I tried to outline some of the philosophical implications of this fascinating machinery. In part two I will try to discuss what Bitcoin taught me about economics. Part three will conclude this series to show what I, a technologist, have learned from the tech perspective by stumbling into Bitcoin.

As mentioned above, I think that any answer to the question _"What have you learned from Bitcoin?"_ will always be incomplete. The systems are too dynamic, the space moving too fast, and the topics too numerous. Politics, game theory, monetary history, network theory, finance, cryptography, information theory, censorship, law and regulation, human organization, psychology — all these and more are areas of expertise which might help to grasp what Bitcoin is.

What have you learned from Bitcoin?
