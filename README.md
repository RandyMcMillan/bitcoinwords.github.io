## A quarterly journal of crypto commentary

This is a collection of essays, blog posts, tweetstorms, and other content created for the crypto community. The authors have given us permission to publish their work with proper attribution. If your work is included in this and you would like us to remove it, please send an email or tweet and we'll remove it asap.

## This is a work in progress...

We might miss something really important in a quarter, and will go back and revise the publication. 

## Going back in time

Another part of this project is going back in time to document the best content that was created in quarters past. We've created an [excel spreadsheet](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArJBIcwWDXdkith-Nytz-N75q-7b9w) you can view to see the content gathered. If something is missing, please get a hold of us(me).
