## What is Crypto Words?
*Crypto Words* is a monthly Bitcoin journal. New journals are published monthly and older journals are published as we get to them. This project began in the spring of 2019, so there's a decade worth of content that needs to be archived. This could take a while!

# Distribution & Format
Our journals are first distributed to our email subscribers and later pushed to followers on Twitter and other social networks. Each publication is available for view as a webpage or pdf download. The journal in pdf format is very readable and all posts are uniform. We're big fans of pdf format because you can easily download journals for safe keeping and sharing with friends.

Check out this PDF journal for reference:

The costs of the journal are met through donations, which are invited in any amount.
