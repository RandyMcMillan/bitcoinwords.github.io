# What is Crypto Words?
*Crypto Words* is a monthly Bitcoin journal. New journals are published monthly and older journals are published as we get to them. This project began in the spring of 2019, so there's a decade worth of content that needs to be archived. This could take a while!

# Distribution & Format
Our journals are first distributed to our email subscribers and later pushed to followers on Twitter and other social networks. Each publication is available for view as a webpage or pdf download. The journal in pdf format is very readable and all posts are uniform. We're big fans of pdf format because you can easily download journals for safe keeping and sharing with friends.

Check out this PDF journal for reference:

# Bitcoin is controlled by miners


# Bitcoin is too slow

# Bitcoin is too expensive

# Bitcoin is bad for the environment

Bitcoin energy usage is all about utilizing the most cost efficient energy, this means using renewables at near zero cost or even capturing energy that would otherwise be wasted, like natural gas flaring.

Yes, it's true that Bitcoin uses energy just like every other money and human activity. A key difference is that Bitcoin uses energy to secure the hardest money mankind has ever known. 

When someone says it is wasteful, they are placing themselves on a morally superior pedistal by trying to tell you what's the best way to use energy. There's nothing immoral about using energy to run Bitcoin.

# Bitcoin is a waste

> "Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin." - Satoshi

# Bitcoin is centralized by Core devs

# Bitcoin has no intrinsic value
We believe Bitcoin having no intrinsic value is a good thing. 

# Bitcoin doesn't scale

# Bitcoin is too volatile

# Bitcoin is for criminals

# Bitcoin is centralized, look at Satoshi's wallet

# Bitcoin isn't money

# Bitcoin gets hacked, look at Mt. Gox

# Bitcoin is deflationary and that's terrible

# Bitcoin will get banned and/or regulated to death
