# Bitcoin is controlled by miners


# Bitcoin is too slow

# Bitcoin is too expensive

# Bitcoin is bad for the environment

Bitcoin energy usage is all about utilizing the most cost efficient energy, this means using renewables at near zero cost or even capturing energy that would otherwise be wasted, like natural gas flaring.

Yes, it's true that Bitcoin uses energy just like every other money and human activity. A key difference is that Bitcoin uses energy to secure the hardest money mankind has ever known. 

When someone says it is wasteful, they are placing themselves on a morally superior pedistal by trying to tell you what's the best way to use energy. There's nothing immoral about using energy to run Bitcoin.
