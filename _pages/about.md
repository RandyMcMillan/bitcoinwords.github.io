# Goals and Scope
Crypto Words is a quarterly journal of cryptocurrency, or crypto, established February 13, 2019. Its purpose is to document and advance commentary and research in disciplines of particular interest to the crypto community. The journal is broad in scope, publishing content from original research, essays, blog posts, and tweetstorms from a wide variety of fields, especially governance, technology, philosophy, politics, and economics, but also legal theory, history, criticism, and social or cultural analysis. Its broader mission is to capture the conversations and think pieces in the crypto space for current and future researchers. Crypto Papers hopes to continue and expand thhttps://mises.org/library/journal-libertarian-studies?Id=3) and [Libertarian Papers](http://libertarianpapers.org/).

## History
There exists a gap in crypto publishing.  For authors with commentary and scholarly papers on crypto topics, the choice of publication outlets is relatively limited. The number of journals that serve as outlets for crypto research is in any event too small, as the number of crypto thinkers continues to grow with every market cycle.  
This generation of crypto thinkers have limited places to submit thought pieces for publication. Content is scattered across the web, and in some cases behind paywalls which prevent the free flow of information. With the advent of the Twitter and blogging, authors also now have the option of self-publishing: they post the content to their own site or some private site, link it in a blog post, or post a working paper. But this is obviously not the best way to document and publish. What is needed is a journal that takes full advantage of the possibilities of the digital age as a go to resource for think pieces in the crypto space. 
Enter Crypto Words. Published independently, Crypto Words is a quarterly journal that welcomes submissions on a range of topics of interest to the crypto community.  In addition to conventional research articles, we welcome review essays blog posts, tweets as well as papers in other formats, such as distinguished lectures.
