## Help Spread 𝗪𝗢𝗥𝗗𝗦

Have a website or use social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn? Consider sharing the content found on **WORDS** or linking to [https://bitcoinwords.github.io](https://bitcoinwords.github.io).

## Follow on Twitter

I'm active on Twitter and use it as the main line of communication. — I don't rapid fire posts but add commentary where we see fit. Posts are typically links to the content here, trolling nocoiners, sarcastic remarks, and other things regarding development of this site.
