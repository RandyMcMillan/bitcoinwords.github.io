Five INSANELY bullish charts for bitcoin. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ $BTC #bitcoin 

1/ Bitcoin looks nothing like the Tulip Mania or South Sea Company bubbles, which only lasted an illiquid and brief 3 years.

Bitcoin has been growing for 10 years with billions of dollars traded daily.

2/ If you dollar cost averaged into bitcoin weekly, every year would result in positive returns at today's prices, including 2018 and 2019.

3/ Bitcoin dominates the best performing tech stocks in returns over the past decade, even when giving tech companies a 4 year head start. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥


Berkshire Hathaway added for fun.

4/ On the scale of a global currency, bitcoin is still small, just passing the Colombian peso and New Zealand dollar in market cap, and is still far from the market cap of gold.

There is tremendous room for bitcoin to grow into a global store of value. ðŸš€

5/ Returns over 10,000% were previously only available to accredited investors and VCs in the form of private equity deals.

Bitcoin levels the playing field, allowing anyone to invest with the opportunity for tremendous gains. #bitcoin #Uber #Facebook #Lyft
