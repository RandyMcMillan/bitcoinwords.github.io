# [Why Monetary Maximalism could fall short of expectations](https://uncommoncore.co/why-monetary-maximalism-could-fall-short-of-expectations/)
### By [Su Zhu](https://twitter.com/zhusu) and [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl)
### Posted February 2, 2019

Monetary maximalism is the idea that in a free market for money one big winner will emerge and that the "soundest" money is in the best position to do so.

In a previous post I [wrote that](https://uncommoncore.co/a-deductive-valuation-framework-for-cryptocurrencies/) "every token competes in one massive power law distribution for the title of dominant non-sovereign monetary store of value. If it does not win this rat race (or comes to a close second or third place), its market share will, effectively, be zero."

The most popular argument for why that should be the case is that it already happened once – with gold.

There are two big assumptions baked into the grand narrative of monetary maximalism today. First, that the world will gravitate towards the soundest monetary-policy coin. And second, that gold-analogies are apt in describing Bitcoin.

We would argue that this is reasoning by analogy, and that the analogy is not self-evident even for many people inside crypto, let alone outside. We should steer clear of suggesting that we can use logic to determine how this will all play out.

Instead, we should realize that for Bitcoin to become what most of the community wishes it to be, there are multiple challenges to overcome that work as counterforces to the consolidation into one money. These counterforces are:

## Misalignment of incentives with crypto companies

Crypto companies are funded with the goal to capture value – especially value that can weather both bull and bear markets. The result is a value capture layer on top of Bitcoin with actors that over time evolve their own opinions that ultimately become social attacks on Bitcoin.

Many of these companies would lose if bitcoin was to become a mature store-of-value tomorrow and since they respond to their shareholders and not the Bitcoin community, it's in their best interest to prevent that.

The biggest "attack" on Bitcoin is the existence of altcoins. Investors and VCs are incentivized to push for a multicoin future because they can be paid for finding the next Bitcoin. Monetary maximalism ascending necessarily implies that this paradigm of crypto-as-tech would come to an end.

Exchanges like Coinbase are also incentivized to push for a multicoin future, as they benefit from people trading back and forth between different assets. Consolidation into one money would mean a massive decline in cross-currency trading. As an exchange, they love drama and volatility in the markets to attract traders. Their support for past contentious Bitcoin forks as an attempt to shape the protocol to suit the needs of their business and later pushing for a world where Bitcoin is just one of many assets have been entirely rational.

Miners can also decide to attack Bitcoin, with Bitmain as a prominent example. When they disliked the direction protocol development was going, possibly because they were afraid that a layered scaling approach would hurt their bottom line, they launched a social attack in the form of Bitcoin Cash. Even though the attack ultimately failed, the fork diluted Bitcoin's supply in the eyes of the public as well as its brand value.

If we look at who is actually incentivized to help Bitcoin become a mature SoV, in terms of crypto businesses there are shockingly few. A mature Bitcoin would force many of them out of business. And yet we find that Bitcoiners are constantly surprised by the so-called impure behavior of companies in this space.

## Culture clash between different currencies

Because of crypto's unique nature of a [social layer and technical implementation](https://uncommoncore.co/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract/) reinforcing each other, all networks are highly cultural in nature.

All coins get their properties from the shared beliefs of their holders. A strong culture has to be enforced so they can retain these properties against change.


![Unpacking Bitcoin's social contract](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/su-1.png){: .align-center}*Image Source: [Unpacking Bitcoin's Social Contract](https://uncommoncore.co/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract/)*


Arjun Balaji and Yassine Elmandrja have recently [laid out](https://medium.com/@yelmandjraark/a-conflict-of-crypto-visions-160dbfc33bfa) how almost all fundamental disagreements in crypto are not about details of implementation, but about the fundamental values that each project enshrines in their social layer.

The result is competing frameworks like "[Vision of the Constrained vs Unconstrained](https://medium.com/@yelmandjraark/a-conflict-of-crypto-visions-160dbfc33bfa)", "[Money crypto vs tech crypto](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/money-crypto-vs-tech-crypto)" or "[Autonomous](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html) vs [Governed](https://medium.com/cryptolawreview/against-szabos-law-for-a-new-crypto-legal-system-d00d0f3d3827)", proving that there is a lot to disagree about when it comes to culture.

Just as the world is unlikely to converge to a single culture, whether we are talking about politics, art, music, language or food, so too can crypto exist for a long time as a pluralistic collection of different cultures.

If we assume there are irreconcilable disagreements on the social layer between projects and that the value of each token is agreed upon at the social layer, then the logical conclusion is that people with different cultures will prefer – and hence monetize – different coins.

We claim Bitcoin is apolitical maximalist money, but in practice the political philosophy views of bitcoiners are homogenous, especially with regards to libertarianism, and distinct from other crypto communities (which your authors [have previously argued](https://uncommoncore.co/evangelizing-bitcoin/) is a dangerous mismatch).

Bitcoiners tend to be [objectivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)) – they believe there is such a thing as objective moral truths. But let us not mistake strongly held opinions for provable truths. We can neither prove that global money will evolve through soft forks rather than hard forks, nor can we prove that a premine is worse than no premine.

We can only show that the tradeoffs are such that we believe certain approaches are more promising than others. But if people disagree with us and these projects don't actually implode as we predict, then this market can well stay fragmented forever.

## Appealing to human biases

Beyond basic preferences that are the result of a different culture, there are some biases inherent to our thinking that can draw people away from Bitcoin's monetary maximalism and towards other forms of money.

The most familiar example is probably the unit bias. When faced with a selection of coins most people intuitively compare the price of one unit, without regard for the number of total units outstanding. As a result, they falsely assume the cheapest unit is underpriced relative to the others and buy it.

Then there are people who have a bias in favor of innovation and tend to promote the new over the old without really looking at its limitations or weaknesses. Pro-innovation bias could play a big role in Bitcoin's future as the incentives of this market (see earlier) are aligned in such a way that crypto companies and investors collectively benefit from a steady flow of new competitors.

The most important bias working against Bitcoin, however, might be the "anti-waste" or "anti-PoW" bias. Already today there are many who categorically refuse to use any currency that uses proof-of-work for security, claiming that it is extremely wasteful and hence dangerous to our environment.

You can expect Bitcoin competitors like Ethereum to lean even more on this bias once they have completed their switch to proof-of-stake.

It's hard to imagine that people with a strong ideological dislike for proof-of-work can be convinced by economic arguments to turn around and embrace it. We find it more likely that this particular bias will continue to appeal to many people in the same way that [easy answers to hard questions](https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx) have always appealed to humans throughout history.

## Conclusion

While we don't fundamentally disagree with the idea that a big winner could emerge from the battle of monies in the ultra-long run, there are also significant counterforces at work to prevent Bitcoin from being that winner.

The counterforces presented today all assume that the market structure itself is uncompromised, i.e. a free market for money exists. In practice, this assumption is hopelessly optimistic. Governments will continue to shape our economic realities as people in the Liberal West will not risk their lives to use one money over another for ideological reasons.

Most Bitcoiners are gleefully unaware of how few companies in this space actually have an incentive to help Bitcoin succeed, especially those who own the customer relationship and onboard all the new people into this space.

Bitcoiners should stop expecting companies, miners, etc. to virtue signal to them and instead [start taking ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism) of the means of production by building their own exchanges, nodes, wallets, custody, and education.

All cryptos are highly cultural. They need to be because they derive their properties from the shared beliefs of all users. This is a major differentiation from gold. The idea of Bitcoin monetary maximalism would require Bitcoin to transcend culture itself if it wants to appeal to people versus other cryptocurrencies.

Many people are questioning the "top-down" analogies used by bitcoiners today. Even many Austrian economists are not buying into Bitcoin [as sound money](https://mises.org/wire/why-cryptocurrencies-will-never-be-safe-havens) .

So instead of mapping the history of gold over the future of bitcoin, we should look where we are today, where we want to be tomorrow, and how we can get there.

# Demystifying Blockchain Not Bitcoin
### By [David Nage](https://medium.com/@david_nage)
### February 9, 2019

![Blockchain not bitcoin](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-1.png){: .align-center}

_This is a conversation that needs to happen now. As many know, I have been part of the family office community for the last decade and have been working to educate my peers on crypto for the last two years. This article comes on the heels of two private luncheons this week, where we discussed crypto amongst other investment themes. The poplar, but incorrect catch phrase, "blockchain, not bitcoin" came up several times and I attempt to identify several drivers of this narrative._

Some of you will read that catch phrase and be filled with 3 emotions: rage and disgust followed by annoyance. Others will think this is a logical separation, and...more importantly, will be more inclined to put their chips down on the Blockchain island.

Non-crypto focused investors hear about IBM and their work with Hyperledger; they hear about JP Morgan and Quorum. These are brand names no different than Nike, Pepsi and Ford; they've been comfortable with them for a long time — but in essence they don't understand the fundamental differences in what IBM and other corporate entities are building (a permissioned DLT) versus what Bitcoin, Ethereum and other protocols are building.

![a photo of a great divide](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-2.png){: .align-center}

Why does this divide exist? How did we get here?

![whitepaper excerpt](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-3.png){: .align-center}

As Garrick Hileman writes:

> "The 2008 financial crisis reached its nadir with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, just six weeks before Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin paper"

This is what was given to the world after the financial crisis — a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash allowing online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Innovation and adaptation has occurred during the last decade, as observed with every other technology society has bore witness to. In addition to Bitcoin we've seen other protocols leveraging the proof-of-work consensus algorithms and we've seen other consensus algorithms be created, such as proof-of-stake.

This discussion is NOT going to delve into which is the best and why, etc. However, at the very core, there is a fundamental lack of understanding from the perspective of the Institutional Investor on several main tenets which need to be illuminated:

1. Difference in Distributed, Centralized and Decentralized Systems;
2. Why we (as a society) need them;
3. Contributor (node) and Incentive models and;
4. Why it can't be in the form of fiat/USD.

![distributed systems](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-4.png){: .align-center}
**Distributed Systems**

The work done by Stanislav Kozlovski: "[A Thorough Introduction to Distributed Systems](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c)" provides color on this; as stated:

> A distributed system in its most simplest definition is a group of computers working together as to appear as a single computer to the end-user.

> These machines have a shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole system's uptime.

**Distributed But Centralized**

As [Julia Poenitzsch](https://www.advancedblockchain.com/en/julia_poenitzsch.html)writes:

> A distributed, but centralized system may sound contradictory but consider a cloud service provider offering a data storage service. Physically, your data could be shared and replicated on different machines according to resource availability and resiliency(distributed). However, wherever the machines and data storage facilities happen to be, the cloud service provider still controls them all (centralized).

Distributed systems and ledgers can be either decentralized, granting equal rights within the protocol to all participants or centralized, designating certain users particular rights.

**Decentralized Systems**

Decentralized and distributed systems, such as Bitcoin, cannot be altered by any one entity. It also runs as a **_peer-to-peer network_** of independent computers spread across the globe.

In conversations with Institutional Investors they understand concepts associated with Distributed Systems but this shift from centrally controlled distributed systems to a P2P network of " **_independent_**" computers/nodes is where the confusion comes in.

**Why We Need Them**

Decentralized, distributed systems offer advantages to their legacy centralized systems. Two of the more pronounced arguments in favor of these new systems that may resonate with traditional, non-crypto investors are:

1. **Fault Tolerance:** Because they rely on many separate components, decentralized systems are less likely to fail accidentally. The recent [Wells Fargo](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/wells-fargo-says-working-to-fully-restore-system-as-outage-spills-into-day-2.html) outage serves as evidence of legacy systems failing.

2. **Attack resistance:** Due to the presence of a lot of players, decentralized systems lack central points of failure; there's no one point of attack that would disarm the entire system. This makes it more expensive and less viable to destroy these systems. This [infographic](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)is very useful to explain the significant amounts of data hacks we as a society have fallen victim to over the last decade and a half.

![privacy breach's](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-5.png){: .align-center}

**Incentive Models**

Cathy Barrera discusses how incentive models help crypto: "[Blockchain Incentive Structures: What they are and why they matter](https://medium.com/prysmeconomics/blockchain-incentives-101-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter-5127afb56aeb)"

As Cathy notes:

> An incentive is any design element of a system that influences the behavior of system participants by changing the relative costs and benefits of choices those participants may make.

> Incentives include pay-for-performance reward systems that compensate individuals with money and they also include systems that incorporate no financial rewards at all.

**Economics of Bitcoin**

As Bitcoin.org states:

> Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.

![mining rig](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/nage-6.png){: .align-center}

This is a fundamentally misunderstood concept; more and more I hear "why can't a bitcoin/blockchain miner be paid in USD/fiat". This sounds ridiculous to people who've been in the ecosystem for years, but this phrase comes from multiple conversations with HNW/Family Office investors. Investors need more education on this topic because it is essential that they understand it.

**Conclusion**

Bitcoin, blockchain and the phrase "crypto" are part of the conversation among Institutional Investors these days; education from crypto investors, researchers and builders has significantly improved over the last year but there continues to be significant deficits in understanding the fundamental roots of the technology. Conversations with investors should focus on the four areas highlighted in this article; especially during the elongated "crypto winter" so they better understand the massive tectonic shift that is underway.

# Bitcoin is a hedge against the cashless society
## When cash is gone, where will you turn to transact with a basic level of privacy? What money do you hold when negative interest rates start eating away at your bank account?
### By [Su Zhu](https://twitter.com/zhusu) and [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl)
### Posted February 12, 2019
![surveillance](/assets/images/cy19q1/cy19q1m2/su-2.png){: .align-center}

The rise of digital payments and the move towards a cashless society are often seen as the same, but there is an important difference between them.

Digital payments like Paypal, Venmo, domestic-, and international bank transfers are convenient for people and businesses to transact with. They represent fintech innovation to consumers by the market. Faster, cheaper, and more efficient forms of digital payments are uncontroversial and largely an engineering and marketing challenge.

They don't, however, remove every need for cash. Cash [has unique properties](https://coincenter.org/files/2019-02/the-case-for-electronic-cash-coin-center.pdf) that digital payments have not. As physical coins and notes, it can be exchanged peer-to-peer without a middleman. Its ownership is transferred simply by handing it over. The absence of an intermediary ensures that transfers are permissionless, censorship-resistant and, most importantly, private.

Digital payments solutions do not utilize physical cash but also do not prevent anyone from continuing to use cash if they want. It is an alternative payment method to cash but is not antithetical to it. Indeed, in almost all modern societies, there coexists both a large digital economy and a large cash economy.

We will argue that the elimination of cash, even if most payments are already digital, will make society more vulnerable to surveillance, financial control, and authoritarianism.

#### **Why do countries go cashless?**

In a cashless society, the government seeks to discourage or even criminalize the holding and using of cash itself. In [Sweden](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/sweden-cashless-society-is-no-longer-a-utopia/), it happened largely without coercion. In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation), the government demonetized the 500 and 1,000 Rupee denominations of notes.

Different countries can have different incentives to push for a cashless society. In China, digital payments are primarily a tool of social control and serve as a backbone for China's social credit system. And they are making progress on it: 96% of cash payments in 2012 have turned into only 15% in 2019.

Over in Europe, central bankers are enthralled by the idea of negative interest rates. A recent IMF report [states that](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/):

> "Severe recessions have historically required 3–6 percentage points cut in policy rates. If another crisis happens, few countries would have that kind of room for monetary policy to respond."

Negative interest rates were traditionally hard to implement because cash served as a lower bound. In a cashless society, this lower bound would disappear. In a severe recession, the CB could drop the policy rate to, say, -4% to make consumption and investment more attractive relative to saving.

Recently, central banks have started to brush everyone who prefers cash with the label of a criminal. They do that by separating the uses of cash into [legitimate and illegitimate](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15118.pdf). People "abroad" can hold cash "legitimately" to replace an unstable or inflationary currency. Now domestically, the only beneficiaries of an anonymity-providing currency are

> "those engaged in tax evasion, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and those wishing to store the proceeds from crime and the means to commit further crimes."

Indeed, the use of cash in larger denominations has become so stigmatized in the US and Europe that withdrawing or carrying above a certain amount requires explicit government permission.

#### Problems of the cashless society

A society without cash has no ability to transact value without the omnipresence of government actors. By going cashless, societies double down on the properties of digital payments but lose all access to the unique properties of cash.

If every payment is intermediated, it becomes impossible to pay someone for anything without there being a record somewhere. It eliminates privacy and places the government as the third party in every financial event.

Governments claim that a cashless society enables them to protect citizens from criminals. The specters of terrorism and organized crime are often cited at this point. But this makes the naive assumption that governments itself can never become evil.

Because all transactions require the consent of an intermediary, they can easily be censored and funds confiscated. It might not be happening right now, but a good monetary system should be robust to changes in political moods. A cashless monetary system is less resistant to both the tyranny of the majority and shifts towards authoritarianism.

Cash may not be the right tool for the majority of transactions, but the elimination of it removes an important choice, and safeguard against government abuse, for the people.

#### Bitcoin as a hedge against the cashless society

When cash is gone, where will you turn to transact with a basic level of privacy? What money do you hold when negative interest rates start eating away at your bank account?

Traditionally, it has been impossible for the private market to come up with solutions for these basic human demands. The state doesn't like competition to their own fiat currency and made sure to quickly shut down all attempts of other monies to enter the market.

Bitcoin could change that. Decentralized and digital in nature, it no longer has the central point of failure that made previous "private monies" vulnerable. And it is modeled to marry the two forms of money — physical cash and digital payments — into an entirely new breed: digital cash. It can be transacted peer-to-peer, is permissionless, does not censor people or transactions, and has a reasonable level of privacy (if one knows how to use it).

We are still early into the Bitcoin-experiment, but with the cashless society looming on the horizon, we more than ever need it to succeed. Its fixed monetary policy already makes it a hedge against high inflation (that is increasingly used in places with collapsing fiat currencies [like Venezuela](https://medium.com/@mattahlborg/nuanced-analysis-of-localbitcoins-data-suggests-bitcoin-is-working-as-satoshi-intended-d8b04d3ac7b2)). But, equally importantly, Bitcoin is a hedge against the demonetization of cash and the rise of the cashless society.
