# Goals and Scope
![CW Logo](/assets/images/cy19q1/words-blue-box-logo.png){: .align-left} Crypto Words is a quarterly journal of cryptocurrency, or crypto, established February 13, 2019. Its purpose is to document and advance commentary and research in disciplines of particular interest to the crypto community. The journal is broad in scope, publishing content from original research, essays, blog posts, and tweetstorms from a wide variety of fields, especially governance, technology, philosophy, politics, and economics, but also legal theory, history, criticism, and social or cultural analysis. Its broader mission is to capture the conversations and think pieces in the crypto space for current and future researchers. Crypto Papers hopes to continue and expand the tradition established by publications such as the [Journal of Libertarian Studies](http://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=3) and [Libertarian Papers](http://libertarianpapers.org/).

## History

There exists a gap in crypto publishing.  For authors with commentary and scholarly papers on crypto topics, the choice of publication outlets is relatively limited. The number of journals that serve as outlets for crypto research is in any event too small, as the number of crypto thinkers continues to grow with every market cycle.

This generation of crypto thinkers have limited places to submit thought pieces for publication. Content is scattered across the web, and in some cases behind paywalls which prevent the free flow of information. With the advent of the Twitter and blogging, authors also now have the option of self-publishing: they post the content to their own site or some private site, link it in a blog post, or post a working paper. But this is obviously not the best way to document and publish. What is needed is a journal that takes full advantage of the possibilities of the digital age as a go to resource for think pieces in the crypto space.

Enter Crypto Words. Published independently, Crypto Words is a quarterly journal that welcomes submissions on a range of topics of interest to the crypto community.  In addition to conventional research articles, we welcome review essays blog posts, tweets as well as papers in other formats, such as distinguished lectures. Finally, wherever possible, content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Crypto Words is open access, and we encourage readers to “[read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles…or use them for any other lawful purpose.](https://doaj.org/faq#definition)” We want our ideas read, spread, and copied.

## My thoughts on the state of crypto in 2018 and where we’re headed
### By [Arjun Balaji](https://medium.com/@arjunblj)
### Posted January  1, 2019

What exploring cryptocurrencies in 2018 feels like.
As another year wraps up, I started writing an email to close friends and investors on the “state of crypto” and my forecasts. As it got longer, it turned into this sprawling post. A few notes:
- This write up contains wide-ranging theses and obvious biases (my own) and is by no means authoritative. Please don’t nitpick.
- Where I make predictions, I try to be as specific as possible (inspired by [SlateStarCodex’s format](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/06/predictions-for-2018/)). Not all predictions are quantifiable. Some will be off and many will likely be directionally incorrect. That’s OK.
- Unless otherwise specified, my criteria for a liquid, actively-traded project “dying” is either (1) < $100k volume/$20m market cap or (2) primary development abandoned, whichever comes first.
- None of these predictions are normative; in many cases I see momentum in products or approaches I consider fundamentally flawed. C’est la vie—this is an attempt at a descriptive 2019 outlook.

### Bitcoin

**1)** After a strong launch in 2018, I see Lightning Network growth continuing into 2019. I predict the number of Lightning nodes with channels will be ≥ 10,000 from ~ [2,100 now](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning) (60% confidence) due to the proliferation of node hardware and hosted solutions (e.g. [Nodl.it](http://nodl.it/), [Casa’s node](https://keys.casa/lightning-bitcoin-node/)) and easy-to-deploy GUIs like Pierre Rochard’s [node launcher](https://github.com/PierreRochard/node-launcher). I predict network capacity will increase even more from ~$2m notional to ≥ $25m+ notional (75% confidence) due to the lifting of maximum channel limits, dual-funded channels, etc.
**2)** At least one major exchange will launch a Lightning Network hub for their users as confidence in the stability and security of the network grows over 2019 (50% confidence). If this occurs, my money is on Binance given their iteration speed and product chops or Coinbase, due to increased focus on adoption and “usage” of cryptocurrencies. I’m particularly excited about Cash App’s potential here given 1) they’re a business that understands Bitcoin 2) Jack sees Bitcoin as [a path to “financial inclusion”](https://twitter.com/jack/status/958743238512328704) and 3) Jack’s [investment in](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/) Lightning Labs’ 2018 seed round.
**3)** A working implementation of [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496/), for which Pieter Wuille released a [draft BIP](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) in July, will make its way into Bitcoin via soft fork by the end of 2019 with ≥ 5% node adoption (75% confidence).
**4)** Low volatility and lower prices always attracts concern trolls and people who believe they can “change” Bitcoin for the better. **The last two years have seen a lot of forks where the codebase is changed but the UTXO set is kept intact. In 2019, I expect to see the opposite: forks with technology kept intact (to merge future upstream changes) where the monetary policy or UTXO set is modified**; an example being the Zclassic team forking Zcash to remove the Founder’s Reward). I predict 2019 will see a major fork proposal from Bitcoin OGs “fixing” post-block reward fee market sustainability either by re-appropriating Satoshi’s Bitcoin (e.g. [my tongue-in-cheek tweet-proposal](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/984114265878614018) for “Bitcoin Freedom”) or by adding predictable, low inflation in favor of the fee-market (50% confidence).
**5)** 2018 was a big year for Bitcoin privacy and fungibility R&D, with proposals for Taproot and Graftroot from Gregory Maxwell in Q1, a draft BIP for the Dandelion protocol in May, and an emergent path for a soft fork upgrade to Schnorr-based signatures. By the end of 2019, there will be a clear roadmap for “good enough” fungibility and privacy on Bitcoin’s base layer across a meaningful set of trade-offs (e.g., speed, confidence level, etc.) (50% confidence).
**6)** 2018 saw [plenty of promising experiments](https://yalls.org/) building products around, with, and on top of Lightning. I anticipate 2019 will see significantly improved UX for developers who want to build with Bitcoin, including [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)/[Truffle-like](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) Javascript wrappers, hosted node services, better docs, tutorials, etc. which makes me very excited about the potential for new products.
  
### Ethereum

**7)** 2018 was a big year for proof of stake research with [June’s deprecation](https://medium.com/@djrtwo/casper-%EF%B8%8F-sharding-28a90077f121) of [EIP 1011](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1011) (Hybrid Casper FFG), scrapping the hybrid PoW/PoS step in favor of moving to pure PoS. The next phase for Ethereum—first termed Shasper (Casper + Sharding), now called Serenity (Ethereum 2.0)—has [six distinct phases](https://github.com/ethhub-io/ethhub/tree/master/ethereum-roadmap/serenity-phases), which stretch over several years. There are 8+ dev teams working on independent implementations including:
- ChainSafe Systems, building a [JS implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/lodestar_chain) called Lodestar
- 50-person ConsenSys-backed PegaSys, building an [enterprise-grade implementation](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon) in Java
- An independent group called Harmony, building a [Java implementation](https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-harmony) based on the original EthereumJ client
- Parity Technologies, building an [Ethereum 2.0 client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum) in Rust
- Prysmatic Labs, building a [Go client](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) (recently, Raul Jordan [announced](https://twitter.com/raulitojordan/status/1079085816209649664) the team had full test coverage with the latest spec)
- Sigma Prime, building a [2.0 client](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) in Rust
- Status, makers of the Ethereum-based [messaging app](https://status.im/), building the first [mobile-native client](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus) in the language Nim
- Trinity, a team predominantly backed by the Ethereum Foundation, building [a client](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm) in Python
Despite seeing major setbacks and changes to the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, I think the first phase will ship some time in Q4 2019 (70% confidence), albeit with friction.
**8)** Augur, whose launch everyone awaited with bated breath, seems to have gained little traction (outside of niche markets around the election). I suspect it will be the breakout dApp of 2019, leaping from [~$1.5-2m notional at stake](https://predictions.global/) to ≥ $10m (70% confidence). My bullishness is due to (1) a full year elapsing with a working product (2) improved UX/choice of clients (3) increased brand awareness (4) demand in the market for a non-custodial prediction market (5) stablecoin integration and (6) better market-making and liquidity provisioning.
**9)** The “crypto-collectibles” narrative which gained major steam in Q1/Q2 (peaking in March’s [$12m raise for Cryptokitties](https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-12-million-funding-for-ethereum-app-cryptokitties)) will lose traction despite the orthogonal interest for tradable in-game items. While collectibles [are interesting](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/nfts-what-are-they-good-for), they feel like a solution looking for a problem (though worth noting: I’m not a tastemaker) and gamer adoption feels like a pipe-dream as companies are unlikely to replace their existing monopolies. I suspect several of 2018’s niche “X-for-Y” Cryptokitties imitators that are less well-funded will shut down next year (85% confidence).
**10)** Despite the hype going into the new year, consumer adoption of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have materially lagged expectations. Relayers leveraging 0x — viewed by many as the best exchange protocol — in aggregate have traded < [$2m notional](https://0xtracker.com/) most days in 2018. I predict December 2019’s aggregate volume on 0x will lag a single day’s volume from Coinbase (90% confidence). **The big problem with DEX adoption in 2018 is that it's unclear who the target user is.**
While non-custodial trading feels like a boon, the trade-offs presented (e.g. in matching/execution speed, the potential for front-running, decreased privacy, the difficulty of accounting, etc.) make it an unappealing product for institutional investors, not even considering the UX curve. Whether retail investor participation will be sufficient for long-term sustainability remains to be seen. In addition, many DEX protocols with fee-based tokens will get forked (like 0x has [by their top relayer](https://medium.com/@ivangbi/hydro-protocol-forking-0x-ddex-to-move-on-governance-and-cartels-inb-a16z-a59b463de20a)), though I predict we'll see a surge in cross-chain swaps and similar non-custodial trading options sans token.
**11)** A lot of early prominent projects promised new types of markets, e.g. for [computation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/golem-network-tokens/) or [storage](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/storj/). Along with the “utility token” narrative, demand for these solutions appears dead, as it’s unclear whether (1) demand for un-censorable XYZ is compelling enough given increased cost relative to centralized alternatives or (2) any of these new marketplaces will be sufficiently bootstrapped to hit the economies of scale necessary for their adoption. Not a single one of the new decentralizing marketplaces promising to marshal distributed or idle resources pose a threat to AWS, Microsoft, Dropbox, etc.
**12)** I anticipate we’ll see major pushback from disenfranchised ETH miners, who will propose a contentious hard-fork (60% confidence). Ethereum’s roadmap is already relatively antagonistic to miners: January’s planned Constantinople upgrade (which, among other changes, reduces block rewards from 3 to 2) hurts miners currently at the margin, likely putting them out of business. While a supply reduction is generally bullish, the upgrade may be short-term bearish (given increased miner inventory sales) if it’s not already priced in.
**13)** “Governance tokens” will be less popular than ever by the end of 2019. To me, they appear misaligned incentive-wise: in practice, it feels like rational token holders should be oriented around (1) entrenching existing power structures (as original token holders have out-sized sway in future protocol decisions, including future value-capture design) and (2) maximizing token value rather than what’s often cited as the goal (maximizing token utility). The excitement around the governance token (e.g. “We don’t need to worry about value-capture, we just need to build something worth governing.”) was a by-product of a never-before-seen crypto bull market and will warrant meaningful skepticism in 2019 (60% confidence).
**14)** On the face of it, decentralized finance (a.k.a. “DeFi” or “Open Finance”), a dominant narrative of Ethereum in 2018, is compelling to me in spite of my Bitcoin bias. A goal of the cryptocurrency movement has always been to increase financial inclusion and the core premise of the “DeFi” movement—to provide crypto-native financial products to the unbanked—has obvious appeal. However, I don’t understand what product market fit looks like for the vast majority of “DeFi” products.

If these products (in many cases, novel non-custodial derivatives or leverage-oriented lending products) are designed for institutions, I struggle to understand how they’ll achieve product market fit for many of the reasons posed in 10 on DEXs. Bootstrapping liquidity will be extremely difficult (i.e., I don’t want to trade an exotic non-custodial derivative with no liquidity and it’s unlikely a marginal trader will want to do the same— the classic chicken-and-egg problem). If these products are designed for retail investors, I don’t understand the product market fit either. The long-shot thesis may be that the globally unbanked are looking for easy entry points that DeFi can solve, e.g. exposure to US capital markets/equities with synthetic on-chain [CFDs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp), but I am doubtful. Most consumers in the world don’t have meaningful savings, mirroring Vanguard-type indices or more complex derivatives doesn’t feel like the right entry point for global adoption.

I believe some of the US-based teams working on the DeFi stack are taking on material risk and will face regulatory scrutiny in the US (70% confidence) given their move into structured products. This will test the runaway killer app of Ethereum: regulatory arbitrage (first with the offering of unregistered securities offerings and now with quasi-legal structured derivatives), as teams “move fast and break [the law].”
**While engineers are discussing “[compounding financial primitives](https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1049471953914945536),” I’m worried about compounding technical (or legal) risk.**

### Other Projects

**15)** Two years after pseudonymous Tom Elvis Jedusor posted a paper outlining the Mimblewimble architecture to the #bitcoin-wizards IRC channel, 2 different implementations, [Grin](https://grin-tech.org/) and [BEAM](https://www.beam.mw/#!), are set to launch in Q1 2019. Both subscribe to different design philosophies, from Grin’s Bitcoin-like immaculate conception to BEAM’s Zcash-like foundation model, in addition to differences in monetary policy, stance on ASICs, etc. I expect both will be meaningful in 2019’s privacy wars, with Grin seizing the lion’s share (≥ 70%) of market interest in Mimblewimble (75% confidence). Though its monetary policy isn’t ideal for early adopters due to high early inflation, it wouldn’t surprise me if it finishes ≥ $250m market cap (60% confidence).
**16)** Given both comments from Zooko about both [PoS](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1047133152592846848) and the [Zcash Founder's Reward](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1058351592464887808) and rumblings from the community, I think it's possible that (1) Zcash plans a multi-year transition to propose a move to a hybrid PoW/PoS system (50% confidence) or that (2) a change to the Founder's Reward (30% confidence) takes place. As the Founder’s Reward runs out in 2020, with a lot of research and engineering work left, I can see a proposal to extend it (or lengthen the reward beyond 2020) emerging.
**17)** It's not a secret [I've been hoping](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1029784219239804928) most un-differentiated “means-of-exchange” tokens (e.g. $IOTA, $DASH, $BCN, $XVG, etc.) will die for some time. With the exception of Litecoin (which has the benefit of an old brand, widespread integration, and Bitcoin “test-net” status) and Dogecoin (which will never die), I expect ≥ half these un-differentiated payment tokens will be flushed out over the next year (70% confidence) as (1) 2018’s price action shows they are subject to the same volatility issues as Bitcoin (2) growth of the Lightning Network dampens need for a “faster Bitcoin” (3) they don’t have interesting innovation keeping a large community engaged the same way other public blockchains do with privacy (e.g. Monero, Grin) or ecosystem products (e.g. Ethereum, EOS, Tezos).
**18)** From the days of the Silk Road, dark net markets (DNMs)—along with pornography—have been a hot bed for cryptocurrency innovation. DNMs have gotten [more sophisticated than ever](https://opaque.link/post/dropgang/), moving from centrally-run sites with single points of failure (e.g. DNS shut-down) to decentralized infrastructures, spider webs of Telegram chats and bots, and better reputation systems. There are still problems: bitcoins are still the pre-eminent cryptocurrency of choice (given lack of customer awareness) despite the lack of better, more private options and the fiat-to-bitcoin conversion is a honeypot for law enforcement agents.
It’s no secret I don’t think there are many real use cases of “blockchain” outside of quasi-legal applications. While it’s directionally clear that the future of DNMs is in moving to a fully decentralized stack (with smart-contract-based escrows, etc.), the lack of privacy on most public blockchains makes this a pipe-dream for 2019. Despite this, DNMs serve as an important crypto mind virus entry-point for many—a painkiller rather than a vitamin.
**19)** With greater focus on the “fairness” of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it’s inevitable we will see new distribution-focused blockchain experiments. While [I’m less enthused](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1036282302492549120), 2019 will likely be the year a Valley-based blockchain project focused on the long-standing goal of “getting crypto in the hands of everyone in the world” comes out. This form of UBI (inb4 “universal blockchain income”) is compelling to many and will have some traction as cryptocurrency mind-share has exploded beyond its libertarian-anarchist roots to include ideologies across the political spectrum.
**20)** $XRP, err, I mean Ripple Labs, Inc. will get a small fine/slap on the wrist from the appropriate regulatory authorities, who will finally confront the fact that [it’s probably an unregistered security](https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1065804676690518017) (80% confidence). Thanks to the regulator-revolving-door, [Ben Lawsky](https://twitter.com/BenLawsky) (a.k.a. Architect of the BitLicense: The World’s Worst Crypto Regulation) is [now on their board](https://www.notion.so/arjunblj/Crypto-Theses-for-2019-0b7f6352c3194814aac9a577e6c43f6c). While it’s unlikely anyone’s going to jail, it’s hard to see Ripple’s egregiousness let them off scot-free.
**21)** Bitcoin Cash [split in 2018](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/11/04/summing-up-the-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-debate/), with factions ABC and Satoshi’s Vision (SV) emerging. While the ABC camp has kept the $BCH ticker, BCHSV lives on. With Bitmain potentially seeing internal issues (rumored layoffs, balance sheet issues, IPO delays) and Craig Wright willing to [see “2014 prices”](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1062752448660541440) to win, this could continue on despite the fact that no one cares. I’m more optimistic about Bitmain’s business than most people, but think that Bitcoin’s dominance v. both forks will grow from today (80% confidence). I also expect ABC’s dominance v. SV (~64% right now) will grow to > 80% by the end of the year (70% confidence). Despite my qualms about Bitmain’s strategic decisions, “Don’t start a hash war with Bitmain” might be as prescient as “Never fight a land war in Asia.”
**22)** 2018 was a big year for Bitcoin forks with Bitcoin’s December peak sparking imitators like Bitcoin Gold ($233m market cap), Bitcoin Diamond ($140m market cap), and Bitcoin Private ($41m market cap). They're all currently Top 25 in market cap and have survived everything from [51% attacks](http://fortune.com/2018/05/29/bitcoin-gold-hack/) and [exposés of covert pre-mines](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private/), but I think they’re unlikely to stay in the top 25 by the end of the year (70% confidence, lest the crypto market's extreme inefficiency fails me).
**23)** Both EOS and Stellar have committed a significant amount of time to building out developer experience and core infrastructure over 2018. Despite [my skepticism](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/07/why-do-we-take-eos-seriously-when-its-clearly-a-plutocracy/) of their potential to be internet money, there’s interest from some dev teams globally to interface with these networks [for decentralized applications](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/21/eos-is-a-dao/). The groups hacking on both networks are extremely well-funded. While they aren’t seen by many in the crypto cognoscenti as “legit” projects, some SV energy might push them to meaningful developer adoption (50+ launched dApps) in 2019.
**24)** I’ve been [whistling with schadenfreude](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1029361436122857472) on “masternodes” for some time. They were the perfect bull market trade: lock up more and more coins as prices go up (even more right-tail vol thanks to the smaller float) but we haven’t seen a true unwinding/liquidity crunch despite the drawdown. I would be very surprised if any masternode projects outside of DASH have the liquidity or community backing to extend life to 2020 (40% confidence… sigh).
**25)** [Token curated registries](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-1-2-0-tcrs-new-theory-and-dev-updates-34c9f079f33d), once the hottest “crypto-economic primitive” on the scene, make less sense to me now than they did before 2018. They strike me as a prime example of 2017’s excesses (and desire to tokenize everything). The model feels extremely convoluted and it wouldn’t surprise me to see the industry move away from the TCR en masse (60% confidence).
**26)** Formal on-chain governance, which saw significant hype in 2017 from projects like [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), [Decred](https://decred.org/), and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) left a lot to be desired. While the goal of formal governance systems is to enable smooth upgrades with input from a range of stakeholders, most suffer from elementary issues, cementing plutocratic regimes rather than enabling open participation. Most experiments with formal governance feel primitive due to the lack of proper tooling (e.g. for anonymous voting). There were some new announcements, including Commonwealth Labs’ [work with Edgeware](https://medium.com/commonwealth-labs/meet-edgeware-25e881e4a37e) (a chain on Parity Substrate) but the long-term viability of formal governance systems remains unclear. In 2019, I think we’ll see some non-trivial core protocol decisions decided on-chain for the first time.
**27)** One thing to be more excited about: with more research in formal governance systems, DAOs could make a comeback over the course of 2019. Widely written off as a failed concept due to [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_%28organization%29), two years later, there are new attempts. One DAO launch which looked cool this year is the [Moloch DAO](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch), which aims to contribute to Ethereum infrastructure and solve the tragedy of the commons problem in the ecosystem’s open-source (infrastructure) development. I’ve [stated before](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1021832335510126593) that “crypto projects should have a plan to dissolve into some future decentralized governance model.” I see crypto projects re-architecting Swiss foundations into DAOs as the first potential “killer use case” and think we will see iterations of this in 2019.

### Private Projects

*Note: I'm not an investor in any of the projects or companies mentioned in this section.*

**28)** Despite sustained drawdowns in public crypto markets, private valuations (particularly for projects coming from Silicon Valley) haven't quite adjusted. Fred Wilson [recently noted](https://www.inc.com/fred-wilson/2019-public-private-markets-uber-lyft-slack-ipo.html) the relationship between public market valuations in the equities market:
> There is a big difference between the private markets and the public markets. They do not move in lockstep. For years now, the late-stage private markets have been trading at valuations that are well in excess of their public market comps. That is true for a number of reasons. First, private market investors have longer time horizons and are looking for a three to five year return, not an immediate one. Second, private market investors get a liquidation preference which in theory protects them from losses. 
>**Finally, deals in the private markets clear in an auction like environment where the highest bidder wins the deal. All of these factors mean that a hot company can raise capital in the private markets at valuations well in excess of where they can raise capital (and trade) in the public markets.**
Most compelling for crypto is the last argument: starved for alpha, [investors pattern-matched](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/994602050372755456) to find “the next Ethereum.” While several crypto-funds still have these investments marked at cost, it’s hard to believe investments made at ≥ $500m valuations (and in many cases, in excess of $1b) will represent gains for investors when the broad public crypto-market has drawn down so significantly. In 2019, I expect that many teams will re-raise at lower valuations or see material drawdowns when listing (90% confidence).
**29)** Some of these networks include Dfinity, Hashgraph, Algorand, Filecoin, Ncent, Thunder Token, etc. I anticipate less than 50% of these networks will launch in 2019 (70% confident).
**30)** The last quarter of 2017 and the first half of 2018 saw sky-high private valuations thanks to a potent combination of new crypto fund/whale money and a path to liquidity that divorced fundamentals and due-diligence in favor of memes and FOMO. As fast paths to liquidity have all but disappeared, I anticipate we’ll see projects return to more “traditional” approaches to raising money (read: equity) and focus on protocol-adjacent business models rather than building new base-layer protocols.
**31)** A launch of [Handshake](https://www.handshake.org/) ([technical overview](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-didnt-know-about-the-handshake-naming-system-how-this-blockchain-project-will-483464309f33)) could be an interesting 2019 development. Though I’m skeptical of their need for a token, replacing the ICANN root server is an interesting problem and it’s clear the current DNS/Certificate Authority system is broken. One potential 2019 development: Handshake serves as a crude but effective solution for sites with regulatory or speech-related risk, which is enough to serve as an effective bootstrapping mechanism.
**32)** One thing I’m not looking forward to in 2019: the battle of messaging app crypto-tokens, with Telegram (TON), Signal (Mobilecoin), and even Whatsapp jumping into the fray. While none of them are interesting as a potential non-sovereign money competitor, I’m most interested in seeing what Facebook does: a [stablecoin designed for remittance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers) could make a meaningful impact while on-boarding millions of people to the cryptocurrency UX (as well as normalizing it in India, a country which [has had 2018 legal bouts](http://fortune.com/2018/02/01/bitcoin-price-india/) around Bitcoin). I’m least excited for Telegram Open Network, who had a [red-hot $1b sale](https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-doubles-amount-raised-in-ico-to-1-7-billion) on the backs of crypto mania, Telegram's traction, and many many pages of techno-babble.

### Stablecoins

**33)** 2018 was definitely “year of the stablecoin” with Paxos Standard’s [PAX](https://www.paxos.com/standard/), Gemini’s [GUSD](https://gemini.com/dollar/), Circle’s [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), Carbon’s [CUSD](https://fiat.carbon.money/), and TrustToken’s [TUSD](https://blog.trusttoken.com/trueusd-a-usd-backed-stablecoin-you-can-trust-9688796cfd0d); though none of these are true decentralized stablecoins (I prefer the term “price-stable asset backed token” or “fiat-coin” if that’s a mouthful).
Since these tokens allow traders to treat exchanges like banks, it should be no surprise that [they are under KYC/AML-scrutiny](https://www.americancryptoassociation.com/2018/12/30/paxos-standard-hassling-ethereum-traders-trying-to-redeem-stablecoin-pax-for-dollars/), like banks. **Fiat-coins are not permission-less**, though [aggregating demand for the product](https://www.tonysheng.com/fiatcoins-aggregators) at the exchange-layer makes perfect strategic sense for exchanges. Even the briefest taint of an unsavory transaction can charge Tyler and Cameron to personally shut down your account.
Holding fiat-coins leaves you at the whim of the issuer to control your financial fate: we’ve just swapped one God for another. While [Tether dominance](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/tether-dominance-drops-to-new-3-year-low-as-other-stablecoins-gain-traction/) has fallen to new lows due to concerns over credit risk and the emergence of these new projects, it’s unclear what product market fit for fiat-coins looks like. Is the use-case as an intermediary safe-haven or settlement currency for traders? Is it a new “digital dollar” with its own ecosystem of products?
In 2019, I anticipate Tether’s dominance of the fiat-coin ecosystem dips below < 50% (75% confidence) with total fiat-coin (counting TUSD, USDT, USDC, PAX, GUSD) exceeds 4b in market-cap from ~2.5b now (80% confidence).
**34)** Despite my reservations about the long-term viability of the model, [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) saw serious growth in 2018 (with [~1.8m ether locked](https://mkr.tools/system) as of this post). While the system is robust—a by-product of excess collateralization in the system (currently ~370%)—use generally seems limited to demand for margin in ether, though the team has shared other [use cases for CDPs](https://medium.com/makerdao/dai-cdp-user-stories-36735f095fda). Continued deposits of ether in CDPs [have affected ether price](https://medium.com/@deepitag/ether-deflation-as-caused-by-makerdao-part-3-a-spur-of-the-moment-analysis-39d0d0d51720), it wouldn't surprise me to see ether in CDPs exceed 3% of total ether in 2019 (60% confident) though less volatile collateral or the emergence of centralized options like [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) may be more appealing.
**35)** After marquee stablecoin project Basis [returned money to investors](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/12/stablecoin-project-basis-is-shutting-down-and-returning-the-majority-of-capital-raised-to-investors/), we lost one of the most interesting experiments in cryptocurrencies. Is it possible for a group of venture capitalists and clever twenty-somethings to bootstrap a price-stable currency based purely on belief (spoiler: probably not for now)? Despite the set-back, teams like [Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol) are working on similar [seignorage shares](https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf) models with plans on decentralizing over time. I think it’s unlikely we see a a seigniorage shares-based stablecoin project launch with > $1b in total issuance in 2019 (80% confidence).
**36)** Fear over Tether’s backing was higher than ever in 2018 with concerns about [banking relationships](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-02/bank-tied-to-tether-goes-quiet-on-relationship-with-crypto-firm), [enablement of price manipulation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-20/bitcoin-rigging-criminal-probe-is-said-to-focus-on-tie-to-tether), and a constant [stream of concerns](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-so-called-tether-audit-that-isnt-an-audit-at-all-5a40cfcc2a75) over a proper “audit” of funds (though this may be [impossible to provide in any conclusive way](https://twitter.com/winklevoss/status/1052581201763033088)). The year ended with a [Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised) hinting that all the reserves may in fact be there. I predict it’s highly likely Tether in fact has all the US dollar deposits they claim they do (85% confidence) but that due to other investigations around criminal activity (e.g. money laundering, market manipulation, etc.), consumers may have their funds locked by authorities in a long withdrawal process, [similar to online poker sites](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2016/04/black-friday-five-years-later-24506.htm) after the infamous “Black Friday” (30% confidence).

### Crypto-funds

**37)** My favorite fundamental indicator is still price action. Earlier this year, [I said](https://tokendaily.co/blog/the-best-fundamental-indicator-new-inflows) about crypto funds:
>Early in the cycle, many progressive funds will allocate to managers to “get smart” on the space (see: Passport Capital, Union Square Ventures, a16z, Sequoia, and others allocating to crypto-funds). This comes out of a recognition that **the new asset class is different than the one that they're used to** but could potentially become much more relevant to their strategy ... As initial hype subsides, a second generation of capital allocators will emerge who are more experienced, taking away capital from the gun-slinging fund managers who rode the first wave. It's highly unlikely that the very best fund managers in a new asset class were also the first to spot it. We're starting to see this now, with Matt Huang and Fred Ehrsam's new fund, a16z's newly announced crypto-fund, and several more unannounced funds raising money in today's crypto bear market.

This has roughly held up as new second-generation funds have raised from:
- (1) more credible LPs [including the Yale endowment](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/yale-investment-chief-david-swensen-jumps-into-crypto-with-bets-on-two-silicon-valley-funds.html) 
- (2) with longer lock-ups and 
- (3) more credible GPs.

With that said, I think funding will slow down in 2019 given:

- (1) lack of momentum in public crypto markets 
- (2) limited investable opportunities given the size of the market and 
- (3) proliferation of beta exposure vehicles. The third point is critical: **many of the largest funds are overweight BTC/ETH, with capital allocators paying excessive fees for beta** (particularly with long-only models). While experienced GPs will have no trouble raising and often argue that BTC/ETH allocation is a portfolio decision, I suspect many LPs will opt for exposure directly through low-cost single/multi-asset investment products.

**38)** With the blood this year, the opportunity for crypto fund differentiation finally emerged— though returns look less than stellar ([Vision Hill's benchmarking](https://medium.com/@visionhill_/vision-hill-crypto-hedge-fund-returns-third-quarter-2018-eae2bc831531) was a positive development). More funds are starting to figure out where they “fit” in the landscape (e.g. fundamental long-only v. long/short v. “generalized mining” etc.) v. generically labeling themselves “crypto funds.” I expect we’ll see similar institutionalization in 2019 top-to-bottom of the entire crypto-fund pipeline, from back-office ops to custody. In addition, many funds will be one-and-done after the last year's price action and will see too many redemptions to continue (the death zone AUM-wise is probably ~$25m unless you skimp majorly on services/legal/salaries).
**40)** Investing strategies from traditional capital markets like activist models, e.g. [Layer1](https://www.coindesk.com/peter-thiel-backs-2-1-million-round-for-crypto-investment-startup-layer1)’s, have been extremely under-explored. While early models look something like Blockstream-meets-trading-firm and questions remain (e.g. is a model where wins are socialized but losses are not sustainable?), I’m excited about the development. One activist model I’m particularly interested in seeing: a fund pursuing legal arbitrage to attempt to secure treasuries from projects where the aggregate value of treasury funds exceed market cap. With the current market landscape, creativity is necessary.

### Product Potpourri

**41)** I've been skeptical of enterprise blockchains and promised I wouldn't spend any more time on them after [my experience](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/926096309446209536) at a meet up last year. That said, it looks like corporate interest in capital-b Blockchain is slowing with depressed crypto prices using things like [earnings call mentions](https://medium.com/utopiapress/blockchains-hype-is-dying-according-to-corporate-america-s-s-p-500-earnings-calls-citations-56b97771ce58) as a useful proxy. Who would've thought? Turns out investment in enterprise or "permissioned" blockchain efforts were only cool while crypto prices (and corporate interest) was mooning.

In many cases, we're in Year 3 or 4 of the "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" experiments that started in the aftermath of the 13-14 Bitcoin bubble. We've already started to see the first casualties as [noted execs](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/blythe-masters-wall-streets-best-known-blockchain-cheerleader-resigns-from-digital-asset-holdings.html) are abandoning projects ranging from R3, Hyperledger, and other efforts from Microsoft, IBM, etc. I expect most of these teams to see layoffs or shut down in 2019 (_75% confidence_) on the back of limited adoption and even more limited utility.

**42)** A positive development of 2018 is the number of new, cheap node-in-a-box hardware products, ranging from boutique consumer products like [Coinmine's](https://coinmine.com) to barebones hardware like [Nodl.it](http://nodl.it)'s. While costs range wildly based on feature-richness and form factor and there are concerns about commodification (from an investors' perspective), this is undoubtedly good for users who want self-sovereignty when interacting with public blockchains. The average industry cost for a full-node box should trend to ~$150 USD (though it can be run even more cheaply [on a Raspberry Pi](https://brettmorrison.com/running-a-bitcoin-lightning-full-node-on-raspberry-pi)). 

**43)** Security tokens saw extreme hype going into 2018 with [hundreds](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/harbor-securities-tokenization/) [of](https://cryptoslate.com/tzero-announces-270-million-investment-from-gsr-capital/) [millions](https://polymath.network/) of dollars in investment to exchanges, token standards, issuers, and more. [**My thesis**](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1006521759795851264) **remains steady that nearly all value generated by tokenized securities will be captured by 1) underwriters 2) asset holders [who benefit from the illiquidity premium] 3) early investors in STOs who can arbitrage sophistication 4) infrastructure providers.**

A little STO inside baseball: as it stands, the space has little traction and is teeming with underwriters—who often stand to _directly_ benefit from the deal from advantageous pricing as principal investors _in addition to_ underwriting fees—hyping up future retail investor interest. Incentives are often misaligned.

**Despite grandiose claims of $80T TAMs, I'm skeptical that security tokens have found investor-market-fit.** It's unclear who the "right" audience for STOs is. It's not institutions, who lack any effective way to hedge or manage risk of these long-only products (or take custody, for that matter). Howard Marks' comment in a [2015 letter on liquidity](http://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2015-03-25-liquidity.pdf) comes to mind:

It's one of my standing rules that "No investment vehicle should promise greater liquidity than is afforded by its underlying assets." If one were to do so, what would be the source of the increase in liquidity? Because there is no such source, the incremental liquidity is usually illusory, fleeting and unreliable, and it works (like a Ponzi scheme) until markets freeze up and the promise of liquidity is tested in tough times.

With investor-market-fit uncertain, a potential macro cycle shift, and lack of institutional-grade infrastructure, and the roadmap to deployment looking uncertain, I'm skeptical the world will be tokenized in 2019. I would be surprised if the actively traded market of (novel) tokenized securities exceeds $2b in the next year.

**44)** There are a wide range of different institutional-grade custody offerings funded in Q4/Q1 of last year set to launch in 2019, either with direct self-custody products or by providing the technology back-end for other custodians. I suspect we'll see a major custody product offering from a traditional sell-side firm (excluding Fidelity Digital Assets) by the end of the new year (_60% confidence_). I also think we'll see the first crypto-native custody solution be granted broker-dealer/qualified custodianship status, a major step in the maturation of the asset class (_75% confidence_).

**45)** I'm bullish on efforts like [Lolli](https://lolli.com/) and [Cash App](https://cash.app/), beautiful products from companies who grok consumer UX and are making meaningful strides to help consumers understand and buy, earn, move, and store cryptocurrencies directly. **I suspect these and new consumer products will lead to millions of people interfacing with a cryptocurrency for the first time in 2019.**

### Crypto Companies

**46)** As [described earlier](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1054791943232856064): Coinbase is fighting a multi-front war. Fidelity, Gemini, and a slew of Wall St. firms are competing for any institutional business. In the event there is an STO battleground to fight over, tZero, Templum, Harbor, Securitize, ASX/Malta/Gibraltar, and others are in fray. The profitable consumer business faces constant pressure from Robinhood, Circle, and Binance.

While their regulatory moat remains strong, Coinbase appears to be going into 2019 heavily focused on [increasing consumer usage/adoption](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/0x) and [aggressively expanding token listings](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-continues-to-explore-support-for-new-digital-assets-92ba4ab7f465) (perhaps motivated by dampened trading volume in a crypto bear market). In 2018, Coinbase launched both their [venture arm](https://ventures.coinbase.com/) and [expanded their M&A activity](https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-crypto-bitcoin-acquisition-strategy-emilie-choi-2018-4) (acquiring Paradex,[Earn.com](http://earn.com), and acqui-hiring many smaller teams) in an effort to become the "Google of crypto."

While I'm skeptical of the strategy to list tokens with dubious utility other efforts, a few facts remain true going into 2019: (1) Coinbase is still synonymous with "place to buy crypto" for millions of consumers. (2) They have a war chest to rival many of the largest companies in the space while (3) having a sizable regulatory moat in the US and (4) top-of-the-line product teams (at least relative to other crypto companies).

In 2019, I expect to see continued expansion into crypto-native consumer products that allow consumers to interface directly with protocols in addition to improvements to exchange infrastructure (as the bear market offers ample time to prepare for the next cycle of adoption).

Coinbase has already launched their Earn.com-based "education" service. Other product moves from them could include: a more consumer friendly wallet ([Toshi](https://www.toshi.org/) refreshed) which allows customers to stake and interface with dApps/Lightning, increased focus on lending (Coinbase is a bank after all), and productization of the OTC workflows as they [expand their institutional presence](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-crypto-jobs-hiring) with sales and trading (other OTC desks lack the product and engineering chops).

I also strongly suspect that Coinbase shifts to a more Bitcoin-friendly position in 2019.

**47)** On the subject of exchanges, after a year spent acquiring [fastest unicorn ever](https://medium.com/digital-alchemy-holdings/binance-the-fastest-profitable-unicorn-in-history-d71dc659dc44) status, I suspect Binance will have a much tougher 2019. What Binance has in engineering chops [they forego in regulatory attack surface area](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1000026792269402113) .

I suspect 2019 will see (1) Binance more comprehensively close access to US participants (_75% confidence_) after facing regulatory action (2) launch a full-on DEX (_80_% _confidence_) (3) launch multiple global fiat on-ramps (_80% confidence_) while (4) becoming the dominant exchange in Africa (_90% confidence_). While regulatory action will slow down growth from prospective US customers, I doubt they'll see a full shut-down given their Malta domicile (_30% confidence_). I would peg a prospective shutdown of BitMEX (given shades of market manipulation/excess leverage) significantly higher (_70% confidence_).

**48)** 2018 was the year of the shitty exchange tokens following the runaway success of Binance's token in 2017 (success always breeds imitators), with many resorting to shady "transaction mining" from companies like [Fcoin](https://medium.com/fcoinofficial/a-new-era-of-transaction-mining-is-coming-and-who-will-be-the-winner-27ca6e670b04), [catex](https://www.catex.io/), [ZBG](https://www.zbg.com/), [coinall](https://www.coinall.com/), [coinex](https://www.coinex.com/), [Cashierest](https://www.cashierest.com/), and [abcc](https://abcc.com/) .

This is a new type of scam: instead of taking fees from customers, these shady third-tier exchanges choose to give back the notional value of trading fees to customers in the form of their native exchange token. This is clearly unsustainable, with a couple of these businesses already shutting down.

Many of these native tokens saw huge jumps in initial volumes from curious traders but are now cesspools of wash-trading given easy gamification. Not only does offering a token represent a serious liability, it represents major counterparty risk as the exchange-token scheme could collapse at any moment. I suspect ≥ 75% of the exchanges offering these trans-mining schemes will shut down in 2019 (_85% confidence_).

**49)** Consensys has had a rough year with major drawdowns in ether and other ERC-20 tokens (held in treasury/launched by Consensys subsidiaries), ending the year with [lay-offs](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/12/07/consensys-blockchain-layoffs/) and plans of [spinning off](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150036/consensys-layoffs-employees-pending-startup-ethereum) most of their less-favorite children. This is a bearish sign and I suspect the majority of projects that are spun off will have trouble raising follow-on financing due to cap-table concerns and broader theses shifts in the ecosystem.

**50)** Given Consensys' contributions to Ethereum infrastructure (including [Infura](https://infura.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/), etc.), it raises meaningful questions about the sustainability of open-source development and how important non-core protocol-adjacent work (e.g. developer infrastructure, etc.) will be funded. Historically, we've seen a few different models:

* A company like [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/) or [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering) (taking cues from Docker, Redis Labs, SUSE, and others), focused on delivering value-added services on top of an open-source protocol. While **their primary orientation is profit-seeking, a large part of the company's resources is committed to maintaining the project**. Historically, this has been seen as unsuccessful (if not on an absolute basis, certainly a questionable risk-adjusted bet) for clear reasons: (1) It was unclear for many years what, if any, services would emerge as potential profit centers. (2) Unlike other new technologies (e.g., a web framework or database), a bet directly on the technology, without layered execution risk, is possible. Despite this, some of the largest contributions to Bitcoin have come from similar teams, indicating that their work was integral.
* An exploratory research group like [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/) (which I believe is entirely self-funded), which has free reign to work on anything they'd like. This sort of patronage model allows for intellectual freedom, including hosting "mercenary" contributors or community members like tenured professors. While the freedom is optimal, funding these types of initiatives is often quite difficult: it requires recurring charitable donation.
* A formal "foundation" which has wider-ranging set of responsibilities, including interaction with regulators, organizing the network launch, etc. This is — of course — sub-optimal and unlikely to be of any interest to communities like Bitcoin's (who have historically pushed back against any formal "Foundation" designation given the many charlatans who've attempted to profit).
* Direct fees from a crypto-network used to support core protocol and protocol-adjacent work, the approach taken by teams like Decred and Zcash.

While economists like Elinor Ostrom have tried to [answer this question](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015WJ1C8W/) in other domains, I suspect we'll see significant iteration on different funding models in 2019.

**51)** While the news of [Bakkt's](https://www.bakkt.com) launch (delayed twice) and the announcement of [Fidelity Digital Assets](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com) were eagerly promoted by the broad crypto-community, I suspect their Q1 launches will have less demand than expected with adoption trickling in over the course of the year. It remains ambiguous to me who the anticipated customer is for Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product. Fidelity's DNA [appears to be deeply-rooted](https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1060905977422200832) around Bitcoin's cypherpunk roots, they will go a long way to combating common worries around [rehypothecation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/08/21/two-things-that-dont-mix-well-bitcoin-rehypothecation-and-chain-forks/#5e8630911e14) during the financialization of Bitcoin.

**52)** [_Disclosure: I'm an advisor to The Block._] 2018 saw the emergence of a number of new media properties (and media-adjacent companies/projects) including [The Block](https://theblockcrypto.com), [Messari](https://messari.io), [BREAKER](https://breakermag.com), [Token Daily](http://tokendaily.co), and [TruStory](https://www.trustory.io/) . While they have various flavors of ideology and differing goals, they all go a long way to legitimizing coverage of an industry plagued with fake news, disingenuous PR, and blatant scams. While regulators have their hands full with low-hanging fruit, these companies are often the first to [expose foul play](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/10/two-identities-one-man-the-story-of-800-million-hedge-fund-fraudster-boaz-manor-who-led-the-alleged-31-million-blockchain-terminal-ico/) — they will continue to play an important role in uncovering the deep underbelly of long-tail crypto projects as the industry continues disciplined self-regulation.

**53)** Bitmain, once the unstoppable inspiration of 1000 "mining is centralized" thought-pieces (a behemoth [staring at a $12b 2018 IPO price](https://www.coindesk.com/report-mining-giant-bitmain-valued-at-12-billion-in-new-funding-round)), doesn't appear to be immune from crypto bear market woes. The bearish case for Bitmain is straightforward: they've suffered immensely from a costly bet on Bitcoin Cash (and an ensuing pissing contest, err, "hash war"), lost some top engineering talent (who are now competitors), and are victims of depressed crypto prices along with other miners. Bitmain has lost technological superiority — their latest, the S15 (23 TH/s) has formidable competition from both BitFury's [Tardis](https://bitfury.com/hardware/tardis) (80 TH/s) and Ebang's [Ebit 11+](http://miner.ebang.com.cn/goods-13.html) (37 TH/s).

Despite additional rumblings that Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan will be replaced with new leadership, I believe Bitmain's obituaries are premature. 2018 saw many people come at the king, though some early competitors are [already shutting down](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1077852315489513472) due to the difficulty and prohibitive cost of 7nm ASIC manufacturing. Bitmain may [never be Ghash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghash.io) but shutting down this year feels like a long shot (_85% confidence_).

**54)** I've [been](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1066032638622863361) [bearish](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/21/overstocks-been-in-a-tailspin-and-even-its-ceos-optimism-cant-save-the-firm-from-a-lack-of-tokenization/) on Overstock (and tZero's) prospects for some time. I think it's highly likely that Overstock successfully spins out their retail business (_85% confidence_) by 2019's end but that their blockchain efforts continue to sputter given a lack of profitability and slower-than-anticipated adoption of security tokens.

**55)** After seeing the $1b in revenue some OTC trading desks were generating in 2017, banks leapt at the opportunity to capture juicy spreads and generous commissions, most notably led (and later [supposedly shuttered](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-05/cryptos-crash-goldman-suspends-trading-desk-plans)) by Goldman. I suspect demand for Wall St. offerings for spot BTC trading will be ~0 given the existing landscape of institutional-grade options (which execute the majority of spot bitcoin trading). It would surprise me if any tier-one bank opened an OTC spot or derivatives trading desk in 2019 (_50% confidence_).

**56)** A large exchange (top-10 in volume) will be hacked in 2019. The bear market is prime time for hackers, particularly with more fringe exchanges laying off some staff amidst difficulties (_50% confidence_).

**57)** As part of broader market consolidation in the bear market, I think we'll see strategic acquisitions by larger companies or early movers in both on-chain analysis (e.g. Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinmetrics) and custody products like Anchor (_60% confidence_).

**58)** Rage over payment system censorship felt like it reached a tipping point in 2018 with Mastercard (downstream [via Patreon](https://twitter.com/Patreon/status/1029551216886341634)), [SWIFT](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1060718757310619649), and even [PayPal demonstrating](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting) that payment networks like [other web-based messaging services](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/twitter-bans-titania-mcgrath-the-best-twitter-troll-ever/) are susceptible to top-down decisions to cut off free flow of money at any point. Bitcoin can potentially catch a lot of these leaks as we saw with late 2018 examples from fringe social-networks [like Gab](https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1067796591669473280) or [controversial personalities](https://bitcoinist.com/patreon-jordan-peterson-bitcoin/) like Jordan Peterson. I anticipate this trend will continue into 2019.

## Regulation

**59)** 2018 also saw many different proposals (from the BIS, IMF, and others) around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) peaking with [this paper](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf) .

The core argument for CBDCs [some economists make](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/central-banks-take-over-digital-payments-no-cryptocurrencies-by-nouriel-roubini-2018-11) are that by moving private deposits to CBDCs, a more safe narrow-banking system system emerges replacing the current commercial and private banking infrastructure (which in turn allows central banks _greater_ control of the economy). Other economists like Ken Rogoff [have made historical arguments](https://medium.com/chainrift-research/cryptocurrencies-are-intrinsically-worthless-assets-says-professor-of-public-policy-and-economics-abba5fd80ddc) in favor of moving to digital cash systems (phasing out large bills) citing both financial efficiencies and greater oversight into money laundering (and downstream crime).

Personally I find CBDCs terribly uninteresting, another attempt to extend to the financial system's Foucauldian panopticon. "CBDCs, not cryptocurrencies" is just the latest of the already-tiring "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" trend. However with the world largely trending towards digital payments, I think CBDCs in some form are inevitable though I doubt we see large-scale consumer-ready deployments in 2019 (_75% confidence_).

**60)** We've already started to see the first [regulatory](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/sec-imposes-its-first-civil-penalties-for-two-icos-violating-security-registration-laws/) [actions](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/11/17/the-sec-cracks-down-on-two-icos-creates-a-template-for-future-enforcement/) come to ICO teams in 2018, with the SEC going after low-hanging fruit, establishing a clear pattern through the process. While no large projects have faced serious regulatory scrutiny, I anticipate the SEC will shift focus here in 2019 with a top-25 project (by market cap) facing injunction (_60% confidence_).

**61)** 2018 saw more Bitcoin ETF proposals than ever with [SolidX-VanEck Bitcoin Trust](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm), [ProShares Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415311/000119312517380111/d464351ds1a.htm) (they also filed a [Short Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415311/000119312517380111/d464351ds1a.htm)), [GraniteShares Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725554/000149315217014676/forms-1.htm) (corresponding [short ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725554/000149315217014676/forms-1.htm)), and others, including more esoteric multi-asset ETFs from companies like Bitwise Investments. Despite outstanding concerns over market manipulation of BTC spot prices, I think it's likely we see a Bitcoin spot ETF approved by the end of the year (_70% confidence_), with my bet on VanEck to grab first approval.

**62)** One place we've seen little regulatory action is with "crypto influencers" facing fines or other actions, though regulators have started [clamping down on celebrities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/11/29/floyd-mayweather-and-dj-khaled-were-paid-to-promote-a-fraudulent-ico/#3ebbcc234665) . Naming names is rude, but this SHA-256 hash has my list of influencers that are more likely to get rekd, with a reveal coming in 2020: a6c061624f97399d08fb58dbd23801ab9d03a9329128f5147a9873c9daf906a1

**63)** Along with excitement over CBDCs, I think it's likely some country (likely smaller) will announce a pilot or experiment around a blockchain-based identity system (_50% confidence_).

### Some closing thoughts on prices and adoption

With this year marking the start of a crypto recession, the focus for many technologists has been around _adoption_ and _usage_ .

In my view, the only thing that can drive crypto _adoption_ is (1) bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies serving as an escape valve for people who are in uncertain monetary regimes (and willing to stomach Bitcoin's volatility), e.g. Venezuela, Iran, etc., (2) people buying into the idea that Bitcoin is effectively a call option on becoming a future store-of-value, or (3) people buying the idea that Ethereum, Dfinity, Tezos, and other crypto-networks represent a radical shift in the way computing works ("Web 3.0") ahead of what will likely be a multi-year validation process.

There may be others, but those three things represent to me the majority of factors that could "drive crypto adoption in the short-term."

As people's interest fade and near-term sell pressure drops off (which we've seen over the last several months), we'll enter a prolonged phase of virtual boredom (read: this is right now) which lasts months, if not years, where many spend time speculating on what's "next" for adoption (post-13/14 cycle this was new protocols like Ethereum, merchant/payment processing tools, etc.) while the majority of people involved in the previous bubble leave.

I don't really worry about questions like short-term adoption drivers. People will buy cryptocurrencies for one of the reasons above, or they won't. Gradually as the market bottoms out, prices becomes more appealing and perhaps renewed interest leads to another cycle, serving a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or maybe the price dips below a point of "no confidence" (i.e., BTC prolonged < $1k) at which point no one has faith and only HODLers of last resort are left (like we saw last cycle). Either way though, the digital sound money genie is out of the bottle.

As I've [noted before](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1025091745376337920), **cryptocurrencies are still in the "risk basket" (along with venture capital) for institutional capital allocators.** Particularly considering a broader macro "risk off" scenario over the next 12–18 months, I doubt bitcoin prices will make new all-time-highs in 2019 (_95% confidence_) and think there's a strong chance we don't break $8k BTC (_60% confidence_).

I think it's unlikely that BTC will be a crisis alpha in the next recession the way many people are hoping (I've also noted [my own signs](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1009464256922873857) of late-cycle behavior). That said, the flight-to-quality to bitcoin and other "blue chip" cryptocurrencies will likely continue into 2019.

Either way, I'll be here studying, investing, and sharing my learnings. Whatever small role I can play in the experiments around non-sovereign money is among the most important projects I'll work on in my lifetime.

"Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price." — Hal Finney

Perhaps we can use some of [Hal's ambition](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1057741782065336320) going into 2019.

## What Crypto Can Tell Us About Macro Markets in 2019
### By [Jill Carlson](https://twitter.com/_jillruth)
###Posted January 1, 2019

Over the last quarter, the market has rejected risk assets across the board in a sudden reversal of the year's trend. The S&P 500 erased its 9% gain over a matter of weeks in October. The Nasdaq index retraced from an 18% gain to end the year down 5%.

But no market has felt more pain recently than that of cryptocurrencies. The aggregate market cap of cryptocurrencies, which topped out at $830 billion last January, has since crumbled to $130 billion. Much of this unwind has occurred only in the last two months, with the crypto market as a whole getting marked down over 40% quarter-to-date.

The cryptocurrency market is admittedly miniscule relative to other asset classes. Cryptocurrency (no matter how big the drawdown) is unlikely to have any impact on broader markets any time soon. Bitcoin has demonstrated no substantial correlation to any other asset, whether equities or gold. Nonetheless, what has been happening with this nascent asset class over the last year may reveal some important macro trends.

Two years ago, at the end of 2016, the cryptocurrency market stood at $15 billion in value. Trading volumes across all cryptocurrencies hovered in the double-digit millions. What led to the asymptotic spike in prices over the course of 2017? While it may be possible to point to certain headlines and technology developments as catalysts, most would probably dismiss the phenomenon as a speculative bubble. They may not be wrong in this characterization, but they may also miss the macro context in which all of this occurred.

We have seen many search for yield trades play out over the last 8 years. With central banks around the world pumping liquidity into the economy, traditionally risky assets have seen their premiums sucked out of them. Emerging markets stocks, bonds, and currencies have benefited from this trend. High beta equities, most notably in the tech sector, have boomed with the FAANG stocks leading the way. This trend has also driven money further out along the risk spectrum into alternative asset classes, ranging from art to cars to venture capital.
![image](/assets/images/cy19q1/jill-1.png){: .align-center}
_With rates like these, who needs hedges?_ Image from Pimco's 2016 Negative Interest Rate Report. [https://global.pimco.com/en-gbl/resources/education/investing-in-a-negative-interest-rate-world](https://global.pimco.com/en-gbl/resources/education/investing-in-a-negative-interest-rate-world)

The cryptocurrency boom of 2017 may have been the illogical conclusion of this global search for yield. It certainly followed this trend, starting as money poured into the relatively lower beta cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin and ethereum). Over time capital found its way into brand new assets as well, the products of initial coin offerings (ICOs) into which investors dumped an estimated $20 billion in the last year and a half, often with little in the way of investor rights or protections. Talk about "risk on"...

But the story has changed since then. If you bought bitcoin at the peak last December and sold today you would be realizing an 80+% loss. Many of bitcoin's brethren, including many ICOs, have performed far worse with some cryptocurrencies getting marked down 95+% this year. The last major legs lower of this correction in October and November have coincided with the broader market sell off.

Perhaps cryptocurrency, the last mover on the way up, is the leading indicator of a broader market fall. If the cryptocurrency boom of 2017 was partly the result of the longest expansionary period the economy has seen in a century, perhaps the bursting crypto bubble of 2018 is the canary in the coal mine that the search for yield has run its course.

The recent downturn across asset classes has been blamed on a global growth slowdown, rising interest rates, and continued political uncertainty. Whether this plays out in 2019 remains to be seen, but if it does, it will manifest first as capital leaves what it perceives to be the riskiest assets.

1. 10 years ago today, in an unknown location, a mysterious figure whose identity is still unknown, tapped a key on his keyboard, spurring his CPU into action.
In doing so, Satoshi reified his vision for a decentralized digital cash that he'd published 3 months earlier.
2. The fan in his computer began spinning to keep the CPU, burning from the burden of work it had been given, from overheating.
The CPU in Satoshi's computer was searching for a special pattern, much like a digital needle in a haystack, that would secure [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin)'s first block.
3. Here is that needle:
0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
It is the hash of Bitcoin's "Genesis Block", which created the first 50 bitcoins ever to be mined (by a quirk of Bitcoin's protocol these 50 bitcoins can never be spent).
4. With a brilliant leap of imagination, Satoshi had done what no one else had been able to do, and which many thought impossible. He had ingeniously incorporated @[adam3us](https://twitter.com/adam3us)'s Hashcash design as a way of securing transactions on a network not controlled by anyone.
5. By burning energy in search of digital needles-in-haystacks, Satoshi's proof-of-work design allowed, for the first time ever, scarcity to be brought to the digital realm:
![Vijay tweet](assets/images/cy19q1/vijay.png){: .align-center}
6. Since the creation of Bitcoin's genesis block on January 3rd, 2009 at 6:15pm (GMT), the Bitcoin network has seen the steady and remarkably reliable creation of blocks for a decade, allowing millions of people to store and transfer value without let or hindrance.
7. While many are obsessed with making price predictions about [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin) in 2019, one thing we can actually predict with high certainty is that Bitcoin blocks will continue to be created approximately every 10 minutes with remarkable reliability.
8. As the Bitcoin network continues to function reliably well into the next decade, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.
9. Slowly but inexorably the world's population will come to recognize the benefit of opting out of the status quo monetary order and returning to a world of true individual financial sovereignty.
10. 10 years hence we will look back at the now 20 year old Genesis Block and recognize its creation as the beginning of a new monetary epoch.
With the tap of a key on his keyboard Satoshi set in motion a sequence of events that set our world financially free.

Addendum: If you're interested in learning more about the genesis block I highly recommend [the fantastic 2013 post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.msg1790805#msg1790805) by the brilliant @[SDLerner](https://twitter.com/SDLerner) .


# [Deconstructing Decentralized Exchanges](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/deconstructing-dex)
## The goal of this Essay is to explain the architectural structure of decentralized exchanges, and the performance and security tradeoffs associated with various architectural choices.
### By [Lindsay X. Lin](https://twitter.com/lindsayxlin?lang=en)

## Introduction

Decentralized exchanges are becoming a critical tool for purchasing and selling an increasing percentage of cryptocurrencies. The term "decentralized exchange" generally refers to distributed ledger protocols and applications that enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without the need to trust a centralized entity to be an intermediary for the trade or a custodian for their cryptocurrencies.

Decentralized exchanges provide a number of important benefits, including (1) lower counterparty risk (i.e., no need to trust a centralized exchange to secure and manage private keys), (2) the potential for lower transaction fees, and (3) a more diverse array of trading pairs that can unlock access to riskier or less liquid cryptocurrencies. As demand for these features increases, decentralized exchange technology may witness tremendous growth in usage, development, and adoption within the next couple of years.

Additionally, decentralized exchange usage is being fueled by concurrent regulatory and industry trends, including (1) a surge in the quantity of distinct cryptocurrencies that makes comprehensive listing impractical, (2) regulatory risks of listing cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges, and (3) users' desire to avoid centralized exchanges' Know-Your-Customer requirements for more private and less censorable transactions.

Decentralized exchanges can differ dramatically in terms of technology, trustlessness, security, legal implications, economic implications, and more. These differences render some exchanges more or less suitable for specific use cases. The goal of this Essay is to explain the architectural structure of decentralized exchanges, and the performance and security tradeoffs associated with various architectural choices. By understanding these technical differences, the reader will have a better grasp of which decentralized exchanges are optimized for which use cases.

## Architecture of a Decentralized Exchange

The term "decentralized exchange" is used colloquially to describe both blockchain-based exchange protocols, as well as applications that leverage the protocols. A decentralized exchange protocol generally describes a software program, hosted on or integrated into one or more distributed ledgers (e.g., Ethereum), that enables peer-to-peer transactions that are automatically settled on the distributed ledger. Users retain sole custody of their private keys throughout the transaction process.

A decentralized exchange application builds on top of a decentralized exchange protocol, and adds an on-chain or off-chain order book database and a graphic user interface (GUI) and/or APIs so that the information is easily accessible.

Overall, a decentralized exchange application can be broken down into the following components:

1. The blockchain platform & technical implementation
2. The counterparty discovery mechanism
3. The order matching algorithm
4. The transaction settlement protocol

A decentralized exchange application may not be fully decentralized in all four components. Note that for many decentralized exchange applications, one or more components may be off-chain/centralized, or otherwise feature economic incentives which would promote a tendency towards centralization.

We will discuss each of these components and provide examples of how some decentralized exchange protocols implement these components.

## 1. Platform & Technical Compatibility

Most decentralized exchange protocols generally operate with tokens that feature the same technical implementation and are on the same distributed ledger platform. For example, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and 0x are independent protocols that are operable only with standardized ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Beyond Ethereum, Stellar's decentralized exchange is operable with tokens issued on the Stellar network, and BitShares' OpenLedger DEX is operable only with tokens issued on the BitShares blockchain platform. Off-chain cryptocurrencies and assets could also be traded through the Stellar decentralized exchange or OpenLedger DEX if an "anchor" issues tokens onto the network that represent ownership of a defined unit of the off-chain cryptocurrency. However, this requires users to trust that the anchor has sufficient reserves of the off-chain cryptocurrency to satisfy all redemptions of the tokens.

A few decentralized exchanges are beginning to use atomic swaps to enable users to atomically trade cryptocurrencies that exist on different blockchain networks (e.g. exchanging Bitcoin for Dogecoin, cryptocurrencies from separate blockchains). However, atomic swaps still require that the transacted cryptocurrencies adhere to certain common technical standards. For example, in BarterDEX, a cross-chain decentralized exchange that enables users to transact cryptocurrencies from different blockchains, atomic swaps are only available for cryptocurrencies from blockchains that have implemented features that mirror the Bitcoin reference implementation, such as BIP65 (Check LockTime Verify) and other standard Bitcoin API methods. In practicality, this means that cryptocurrencies that were built off the Bitcoin reference implementation, such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, or cryptocurrencies that forked from Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, will be the easiest to make compatible for atomic swaps with Bitcoin.

Cross-chain swap technologies like PolkaDot and Cosmos are also building tools and protocols that could eventually be integrated into decentralized exchange applications that can atomically swap tokens from different blockchains. However, given the current latency of most cross-chain atomic swaps (with transaction confirmations dependent on the confirmation times of both cryptocurrencies' underlying blockchains), most popular decentralized exchange applications currently focus exclusively on token trading within one chain. As PolkaDot, Cosmos, and other interchain swap tools and protocols are refined and developed in conjunction with Lightning, Raiden, and other transaction performance-enhancing upgrades, some day users may enjoy liquid and low latency cross-chain decentralized exchanges.

## 2. Counterparty Discovery Mechanisms

Counterparty discovery mechanisms enable buyers to discover sellers who are willing to execute transactions on mutually acceptable terms. On traditional cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex, and Kraken, users have the option of submitting both market orders and limit orders, and these orders are automatically matched with unidentified counterparties using the exchange's central limit order book which aggregates all user orders.

Most decentralized exchanges also have order books. These order books may exist on-chain, hosted on a distributed ledger, or off-chain, hosted by third parties. Most decentralized order books display the separate orders of each counterparty, rather than the aggregated orders of all counterparties. Users normally will need to identify a particular order, and thus a particular counterparty, in order to trade.

Some decentralized exchanges do not have order books and instead feature a reserve-based model. A reserve provides a supply and demand of various tokens that are readily available to be executed based on the reserve's quoted buy and sell prices for that token. These reserves are created by on-chain smart contracts that enforce the trade execution and settlement process. The trade price may also be programmatically determined by a smart contract.

For the rest of this Essay, the term "Maker" will refer to the party that provides an order, and the term "Taker" will refer to the party that fills it.

##### _**On-chain order book**_

On-chain order books are hosted directly on the distributed ledger: all orders are submitted to the distributed ledger network and are confirmed by the network. Anyone can host and access a copy of the order book, and anyone may submit their own orders to be included in the order book as long as the distributed ledger is public.

Examples of on-chain order books include the Bitshares and Stellar decentralized exchanges. In the Stellar network, users submit orders which are hosted on a persistent and public on-chain order book in the Stellar distributed ledger. Information about this order book is broadcast to all Stellar validator nodes and is viewable by the public. When two orders intersect in price, the trade is automatically executed and settled by the Stellar network. The BitShares decentralized exchange operates under a similar model, but for the BitShares blockchain and network.

**Benefits:**

1. **Less censorable:** There is lower reliance on a centralized party to host and operate the order book. There may be a centralized GUI for the order book, but any independent party would be able to create separate GUIs and populate it with the on-chain data. Assuming that hosting and operating of the order book is distributed across independent, non-colluding validator nodes, there is no centralized point of attack, compromise, or liability that would result in the order book being shut down or specific orders being restricted by a centralized party.
2. **Less trust required:** Decentralized, on-chain order book hosting means that one does not need to trust centralized, off-chain actors to accurately and reliably publish or broadcast order books.

**Trade-offs:**

1. **Order book inherits performance, cost, and security characteristics of the underlying blockchain:** The speed and cost of submitting or removing an offer on an on-chain order book are limited by of the speed and cost of interacting with the underlying blockchain. Users must pay for each order book update on the network, wait for the network to reach consensus on their updates, and then wait for secure confirmation of the updates. If the blockchain is compromised by an attack, the order book may be compromised. Therefore, slower and higher fee blockchains are less favorable for hosting a user-friendly on-chain order book.
2. **Slower updates:** In the absence of second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network or Raiden Network, on-chain order books are generally updated based on the information contained in the latest block or ledger. This creates latency which could range from minutes to seconds depending on the platform. In contrast, off-chain order books can support almost-instantaneous updates given that most only need to alter a centralized database to reflect the update.
3. **Stale orders:** On-chain decentralized exchanges generally support resting orders, where the desired price and quantity have been fixed by the Maker upon creation of an offer. In a resting order, the offer must be proactively canceled by the Maker if she no longer wishes to trade on those terms if, for example, the price has changed dramatically. Since updates to on-chain order books can have delays due to the speed of transaction validations of the underlying network, on-chain order books could create an environment where resting orders are exploited when there is high price volatility. However, as usage of on-chain order books grows, we expect to see growth and adoption of trading tools (such as trading bots) to help users programmatically automate the submission and cancellation of order upon market price changes.

##### _**Off-chain order books**_

Off-chain order books are order books that are hosted by a centralized entity outside of a distributed ledger. The centralized entity helps parties discover other parties who make offers on the asset and can restrict access to view or submit to the order book.

The practicality of using an on-chain or off-chain order book depends significantly on the performance of the chain. Decentralized exchanges normally do not employ on-chain order books given that every order and adjustment to an on-chain order book would require an update to the blockchain, thereby incurring transaction fees and wait time. On certain chains, transaction fees are negligible and wait times are on the order of seconds. Under these circumstances, an on-chain order book is practical to use for moderate volumes of intermittent orders. Comparatively, on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees are non-negligible and wait times are on the order of minutes. Using an Ethereum on-chain order book would likely incur expensive transaction fees and debilitating wait times. For this reason, four of the most prominent decentralized exchanges in Ethereum—0x, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and IDEX—employ off-chain order books. As of October 2018, 0x, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and IDEX support ERC-20 tokens.

* In the 0x ecosystem, entities called "Relayers" host, manage, and publish off-chain order books. Makers will submit buy and sell orders directly to a Relayer, and the Relayer will aggregate all received orders into its order book. Takers discover Makers' orders by querying the Relayer's order books. Upon finding a suitable order, a Taker will fill the order by submitting information pursuant to the 0x protocol to the 0x exchange contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Given that all Relayers use the 0x protocol for settlement, a Relayer may choose to share its order books with other Relayers, thereby unlocking thicker order books and greater liquidity.
* On the AirSwap platform, a Maker will submit an "intent to trade" in a certain trading pair to an entity called the "Indexer." The Indexer will aggregate information about the Makers and their intents to trade. Takers who wish to trade in a certain trading pair will query the Indexer to discover the identities of suitable Makers, using the Indexer as a counterparty discovery mechanism. Once a Taker finds a suitable Maker, they will negotiate off-chain on the terms of the trade, potentially using the input of an off-chain "Oracle" that will suggest fair pricing for the trade. Once the Maker responds with an order that is satisfactory to the Taker, the Taker will submit the order to the Ethereum blockchain.
* On the EtherDelta web application, in order to make or fulfill an order, Makers and Takers will deposit tokens from their Ethereum wallet into EtherDelta's on-chain smart contract. Makers will submit orders to be publicly broadcast on the EtherDelta off-chain order book, and the order book will ping the blockchain to verify that the Maker has sufficient balance deposited in the smart contract to fulfill the order. Takers will then select an order and click "Buy" on the web application, causing the EtherDelta smart contract to perform the trade.
* On the IDEX web application, in order to make or fulfill an order, users will deposit tokens from their Ethereum wallet into an IDEX smart contract. Users then use the IDEX application interface to place buy and sell orders on an off-chain order book. IDEX and EtherDelta have similar structures in that they both integrate an off-chain order book with an on-chain smart contract for settlement, but IDEX adds on a "transaction processing arbiter" that helps to manage the order of pending trades so that trades are confirmed in the correct order. Therefore, as users trade, the IDEX application interface will update their displayed balances in real-time, but the on-chain settlement may occur with a delay given that transactions are queued. By controlling the order of transactions, IDEX separates trade execution from trade settlement, facilitating a smoother user experience.

There are both benefits and tradeoffs to having an off-chain order book.

**Benefits:**

* **Performance improvements:** Off-chain order books are better able to accommodate quick order turnover. Instead of waiting for a block to be mined and confirmed (or, alternatively, a ledger to be updated) to update the order book, off-chain services can update ledgers almost instantaneously.
* **Cost improvements:** There is no need to pay a transaction fee in order to submit or update an order.
* **Fewer blockchain-originated risks to the order book:** Given that the order books are hosted off-chain, the order books would not be vulnerable to blockchain-originated vulnerabilities such as 51% attacks (where users may reverse transactions) and front-running (where users may submit higher transaction fees for their offers to be included or updated faster than others').
* **Compatible with all ERC-20 tokens:** Any token that has the ERC-20 technical implementation can be traded on these decentralized exchange protocols. The token does not necessarily need to be approved, audited, or reviewed by anyone to be traded.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Higher degree of trust required:** Users must rely on the hosts of the off-chain order book to properly broadcast orders. These hosts could fail to accurately display and update orders, such that users would not be able to rely on them to discover counterparties. In the worst case scenario, these hosts could choose to arbitrarily censor valid orders or manipulate markets by strategically displaying inaccurate or outdated orders. Additionally, hackers could change the off-chain order book interface to manipulate users into sending cryptocurrency to the hackers' cryptocurrency accounts.
* **Greater restrictions:** As a centralized entity, the operator of the off-chain order book may be subject to greater legal and regulatory requirements, such as the implementation of Know-Your-Customer requirements, obtainment of requisite authorizations and licenses needed to trade cryptocurrencies classified as securities, and the implementation of rules and policies against market manipulation. While these requirements are helpful in preventing unlawful and abusive uses of the order book, these requirements may raise concerns about transaction privacy, open accessibility, and user experience.
* **Inaccurate order books:** Given that there is a mismatch in timing between a Maker's submission of an order and a Taker's fulfillment of an order, any given order displayed on an off-chain order book may be outdated by the time that the Taker wishes to fill the order. For example, the Maker may already have withdrawn the tokens that she wanted to trade, yet her order is still posted on a Relayer. Therefore, the Taker may attempt to fill an order by submitting a transaction to the blockchain, only to realize that the order is no longer valid. This could delay the Taker and consume significant amounts of transaction fees.

##### _**No (or hidden) order book: liquidity reserves**_

To solve the issue of low liquidity, some decentralized exchange protocols, such as KyberNetwork, Bancor, and Omega One build up and/or leverage liquidity reserves that are readily accessible when users wish to exchange tokens. The performance of these models depends on reserve depth/breadth and accurate pricing.

* In KyberNetwork, "Reserve Contributors" contribute tokens to build up "Reserves" of a variety of tokens. Each Reserve has a conversion rate for each trading pair, managed dynamically by a Reserve Manager. If a user wants to exchange token A for token B, she will send tokens to the KyberNetwork smart contract and the KyberNetwork will find her the most favorable rate, as determined by Reserve Managers. If such rate meets the user's pre-defined minimum requirements, the smart contract will send the corresponding amount of token B to the sender's pre-specified address. The user can view and approve the worst-case rate prior to sending any tokens.
* In Bancor, users can exchange tokens for other tokens through smart contracts called "Smart Tokens," which store reserves of ERC-20-compliant tokens and ether. To illustrate, users who wish to exchange token A for token B would need to find a Smart Token contract holding both tokens in reserve (i.e., Smart_Token_AB). The user would send token A to Smart_Token_AB, thereby buying some number of Smart_Token_AB tokens based on token A's formulaic price. Next, the user would send the Smart_Token_AB tokens to its smart contract, thereby destroying those tokens and pulling out a number of B token based on token B's formulaic price. Prices are programmatically determined through a formula that factors in the reserve supply of each token plus a constant reserve ratio.
* Omega One aims to aggregate liquidity across cryptocurrency exchanges by treating the entire centralized and decentralized exchange landscape as a potential reserve. Users who want to trade token A for token B will deposit token A in the Omega One's on-chain smart contract and submit an order to trade token B subject to timing and pricing limits. Omega One will then use its own centralized and decentralized exchange accounts to purchase token B and trade it with the user's token A in a swap via the smart contract.

**Benefits:**

* **Lower friction to trade:** The reserve model enables users to enter trades more easily given that the supply and demand sides (i.e., the reserve) have fixed terms and are readily available to trade upon those terms. This removes the potential friction involved in discovering counterparties and negotiating.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Requires trust in a smart contract or third party:** The model requires a party to trust in the security, accuracy, and fairness of the smart contract or third party that is performing the reserve and/or order fulfillment functions. Given that smart contracts are complex, difficult to audit, and may have unanticipated security vulnerabilities, users could lose funds if the smart contract is hacked or misbehaves. Models that rely on third parties to provide liquidity, such as KyberNetwork and Omega One, require users to trust these third parties to act reliably and fairly.
* **Uncertain pricing:** Given that there is high volatility in token prices, some models require users to trust a centralized party to provide fair and updated pricing. Meanwhile, models that rely on deterministic pricing algorithms could be easily exploited by arbitrageurs.
* **Tendency to favor large reserve contributors:** Reserve models that rely on users to fund reserves may incentivize larger reserve contributors to participate more than smaller reserve contributors since lower spreads on trades will require higher volume to be profitable. In that case, users may need to depend on the participation of large reserve contributors for liquidity, leading to more centralized control of reserve supply.
* **Reserves may be available and liquid only for the most popular tokens:** Tokens that are new or exotic may not have reserves available or may have insufficient reserves to fulfill trades based on a user's desired price and quantity. Only commonly traded tokens are likely to have deep, liquid reserves.

## 3. Matching Mechanisms

Matching is the process through which buy orders are paired with sell orders that have mutually acceptable terms. Decentralized exchanges may feature automatic matching or require Takers to manually identify and fill an order. Automatic matching occurs when a computer algorithm is used to pair and execute buy and sell orders. "Manual" order filling is the process through which Takers identify a resting order on the order book and actively perform actions to execute that particular order.

On centralized exchanges, all user orders are aggregated, and users are able to submit market orders and limit orders. A market order is a buy or sell order that is executed instantaneously based on the current market price, and a limit order is a buy or sell order where a user will specify a maximum purchase price or minimum sale price, and will only be matched with orders that offer a price that is at or more favorable than the specified price. Market orders allow users to obtain market price for their orders without having to specify a desired price, thereby increasing the speed and ease of trade, whereas limit orders allow users to obtain market price for their orders while protecting them from trades that are less favorable than a specified minimum or maximum price.

By comparison, most non-reserve-based decentralized exchange protocols do not have market orders or limit orders. These protocols often feature manual order filling whereby Makers will submit resting orders that specify a fixed price and volume, and Takers will fill these orders based on the Makers' specified terms. Therefore, if prices of the trading assets change significantly after a Maker places an order, and the Maker does not have an opportunity to correct the price, the order may get filled at a price that is less favorable to market price. However, developers of off-chain order books, user interface applications, and bots for these protocols can implement off-chain logic that mimics automatic order filling by allowing a user to specify desired parameters off-chain, and programmatically selecting the most favorable order that meets the user's specified parameters.

Reserve-based decentralized exchange protocols may feature automatic matching services that function similar to limit orders. Prior to execution, the user may query a smart contract or an off-chain party about the reserve's current exchange rate, and some protocols have built-in guarantees that the user will receive an exchange rate that is at least as favorable as a stated exchange rate or a user's specified exchange rate.

Analyzing a decentralized exchange's order matching algorithm is important because this will affect its ease of use, ability to provide fair exchange rates, and wait time between order creation and order fulfillment (i.e., the latency of order fulfillment). Moreover, the algorithm also informs the arbitrage opportunities that could arise from manipulating the prioritization and speed of matching through mechanisms such as front-running.

_Manual order filling_

With manual order filling, Takers must proactively find and accept a counterparty order. This mechanism introduces more latency into order filling, but generally requires less trust and provides users more control given that users do not have to rely on a centralized or smart contract-based matching algorithm.

For example, in 0x, Takers discover Makers' orders via Relayers. If a Taker wishes to accept an order, she will submit a counterorder to the Relayer and digitally sign and send the completed transaction to an on-chain smart contract that will settle the transaction. If a Maker's orders are not actively monitored, Takers could exploit stale orders upon changes in the fair market price of the underlying token. However, off-chain bots and services could help the Maker programmatically manage its orders based on market price fluctuations.

In AirSwap, users can query Indexers to find addresses of counterparties. Users must negotiate with counterparties privately to reach agreement on transaction terms and fulfill an order. This mechanism helps to protect Makers from losing money on stale orders (e.g., orders that are not reflective of current price movements).

On EtherDelta, Makers will post resting orders onto the order book, specifying a desired price and quantity for a trade. A Taker must manually select a Maker's order from the order book and submit the order on the web application. Even if there are buy and sell orders that intersect on their desired terms, EtherDelta will not automatically match and execute these orders. The absence of an automatic order matching creates more latency and friction, given that Takers must manually identify suitable trades. However, no central party is needed to fairly and reliably match orders.

_Automated order filling_

With automated order filling, an algorithm will match orders automatically. Automated order filling reduces the amount of user time and effort needed to identify suitable trades, thereby reducing order filling latency. However, this approach requires users to trust the matching mechanism to execute securely and provide them a favorable price.

Decentralized exchanges employing liquidity reserves have automated order filling. In KyberNetwork, Reserve Managers feed dynamic exchange rates into the KyberNetwork smart contract and orders are filled at the current exchange rate. In Bancor, orders are fulfilled automatically based on a deterministic pricing formula built into the smart contract. In Omega One, orders are fulfilled automatically based on the best rate found across multiple exchanges.

IDEX is a non-reserve-based decentralized exchange that employs automated order filling. On IDEX, users may submit limit and market orders because the application has built-in off-chain order matching algorithm that helps match orders on the off-chain order book. The user will be matched with the most favorable order that is available on the order books, provided that it is more favorable than the user's stated baseline price. This off-chain matching logic significantly improves the user experience; at the same time, users must trust IDEX's order matching algorithm to fairly and reliably match orders.

On the Stellar decentralized exchange protocol, users may also submit limit orders to the on-chain order book. The Stellar decentralized exchange has an on-chain order matching algorithm that matches orders based on a first-in-price, first-in-time principle: orders are automatically filled such that, when an acceptable counterorder is found, the earliest submitted order made will be filled. The on-chain order matching algorithm is built into the Stellar network protocol, meaning that there is no need to trust a centralized party to perform the order matching.

## 4. Transaction Settlement

All decentralized exchanges feature on-chain settlement. On-chain settlement is a necessary element that enables users to eliminate the need to trust a centralized party (such as a centralized exchange) to control user assets, settle trades, and ensure that account balances are correct. On-chain settlement helps users publicly verify on the ledger that their trades were settled according to their desired terms.

The performance of any decentralized exchange is limited, at the very minimum, by the latency involved in securely confirming a transaction on the underlying chain. Therefore, the speed of confirming a transaction in a distributed ledger network is the bottleneck for decentralized exchanges.

Some distributed ledgers feature significantly higher latency than others. A secure settlement confirmation on the Bitcoin network may take hours, whereas a secure confirmation on Ethereum generally takes minutes under current limitations. Confirmations on certain more recent platforms can require a few seconds. Therefore, the final settlement time would depend heavily on the confirmation latency of the underlying chain.

## Different Exchanges, Different Use Cases

Each decentralized exchange presents a different array of latency, security, liquidity, privacy, interoperability, and trust tradeoffs. Therefore, different exchanges will excel in different use cases and requirements.

### Access

First and foremost, different decentralized exchanges offer access to different cryptocurrencies.

Many cryptocurrencies issued in 2017 and 2018 are ERC-20 tokens; in order to purchase these tokens, one must use an decentralized exchange protocol that is compatible with the ERC-20 technical standard, such as 0x or IDEX. Similarly, as some new ICOs are held on competing platforms such as Stellar and Waves, one may be pushed to use their respective decentralized exchanges to transact tokens issued on those platforms.

### Security

With respect to the technical security of Ethereum smart contract-based exchange protocols, the smart contract driving the exchange protocol may be vulnerable to accidents and security vulnerabilities. The degree to which a smart contract will function as intended and will not be vulnerable to exploits remains somewhat uncertain given the difficulty of thoroughly auditing Ethereum's Turing-complete smart contracts. By contrast, distributed ledgers with on-chain native decentralized exchange functionality should in theory have significantly lower attack surface given that protocols are more thoroughly audited and require network consensus to change and exploit.

The security of a decentralized exchange is limited also to the security of the underlying distributed ledger. For example, if a proof of work blockchain is attacked, such as through a "51 percent" attack, settled transactions may be reversed despite a large number of block confirmations. Under any consensus mechanism, the network's validator nodes could also collude to "fork" to an alternate state of transactions (and orders, in the case of an on-chain order book), adopt a technical standard that is incompatible to the decentralized exchange protocol, censor (i.e. ignore) orders submitted by certain addresses, modify order settlement, matching, and reserve smart contracts, and more. Therefore, the ultimate security of a decentralized exchange is dependent on the security of the underlying distributed ledger.

Transactions that require strong security conditions should be settled using thoroughly audited smart contracts and distributed ledger platforms with a consistent history of guaranteed functionality.

### Liquidity

Many new cryptocurrencies may only be available for purchase or sale through decentralized exchanges, given that centralized exchanges have been slow to list new tokens due to regulatory risk. Therefore, many cryptocurrencies may only be attainable and tradable over decentralized exchanges. However, a decentralized exchange would not be practically useful for users if it did not have robust order books or other mechanisms that enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without significant price slippage.

The use of interoperable decentralized exchange protocols enable applications that use the same protocol to be able to pool together liquidity for "networked liquidity." For example, Relayers built on 0x may pool together their order books to build a thicker order book. Any token issued on the Stellar platform can be exchanged with any other token issued on Stellar, generating a network-wide order book. While liquidity on decentralized exchanges is currently significantly lower than on popular centralized exchanges, interoperable protocols will hopefully spur greater networked liquidity.

### Latency

The latency of a decentralized exchange depends on the speed of the underlying distributed ledger. For example, if it takes 3 minutes to confirm one transaction in Ethereum, then an order would be settled in 3 minutes at a minimum given that the ultimate settlement of a trade must be on-chain. This latency will likely improve as the Ethereum network adopts new technologies to increase throughput and lower validation time.

Some distributed ledger networks permit significantly faster on-chain settlements due to the use of different consensus mechanisms. For example, an order or settlement on Stellar can be securely confirmed in 5 seconds due to the speed of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The on-chain order books on Stellar would be slower to update than the off-chain order books on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, but third parties could eventually develop off-chain order books for the Stellar decentralized exchange, as well.

Even the lowest latency decentralized exchanges currently cannot compete with the near-instantaneous settlement speeds of centralized exchanges. For users who engage in high-frequency trading activities, centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Pro, Bittrex, Kraken, and Poloniex may still be the best choice, given that market orders can potentially be placed and settled in seconds. Moreover, until the stable release of cross-chain atomic swaps, centralized exchanges are still the best platforms for trades swapping tokens that were issued across multiple chains.

### Cost

The cost of using a decentralized exchange application includes the costs of (1) fees to the decentralized exchange application, (2) fees of making and/or taking orders, (3) fees involved in interacting with any smart contracts enabling the decentralized exchange protocol, and (4) fees involved in settling a transaction to the distributed ledger. These costs may include blockchain network transaction costs (e.g. using ETH for transaction fees for settling a transaction on the Ethereum) or fees for using a certain protocol (e.g. paying ZRX tokens to 0x Relayers for trading fees). Settlement on some blockchains may cost more than a settlement on others.

Whereas centralized exchanges tend to charge fees that are a percentage of the total transaction size, the cost of using a decentralized exchange tends to be fixed per transaction: a high-value transaction would incur the same fees as a microtransaction. Therefore, those who are submitting high-value transactions may save transaction fees by using a decentralized exchange.

### Trust Level

Different decentralized exchange applications require different levels of user trust. Users may need to trust: (1) the decentralized exchange application creator and operator to perform activities such as hosting and publishing order books or performing order matching, (2) the underlying decentralized exchange protocol, including relevant smart contracts, and (3) the security, miners, and validators of the underlying distributed ledger. Users must trust each part of the exchange application stack to perform its job fairly, reliably, and securely. If any part of the stack fails, users may be unable to reliably and securely submit and fill orders, match with orders that meet their specified criteria, and confirm the settlement of trades. Moreover, users may find that trusted parties could censor some of their transactions or act in a self-interested manner to the users' detriment.

Some users may want to minimize trust in the decentralized exchange application layer: therefore, they would want to minimize reliance on the application to host and publish order books and/or perform order matching. Therefore, these users may choose applications that have on-chain order books. They may also choose applications that do not have automatic order matching.

Some users may want to minimize trust in the decentralized exchange protocol by making sure that the protocol has a minimal attack surface. These users may choose to only interface with highly audited protocols such as 0x protocol, or an on-chain, difficult-to-modify protocol such as the Stellar protocol.

Lastly, some users may want to minimize trust in the security, miners, and validators of the underlying distributed ledger. Different users will have different opinions on which distributed ledgers have the most favorable, trust-minimized characteristics; factors such as the ledger's security and exploits history, audit history, consensus mechanism, governance mechanisms, and distribution of miners and nodes could all contribute to this calculus.

Practically speaking, many users may not be overly concerned about trusting decentralized exchanges given that users do not relinquish control over their private keys. Ultimately, most users may prefer a better user experience rather than optimizing for trust minimization. Users must decide on the level of trust that is necessary for their personal use cases for a decentralized exchange.

## Conclusion

The term "decentralized exchange" encompasses diverse applications and protocols that differ in architecture, but all enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without relinquishing control over their private keys to an intermediary.

Decentralized exchanges are still in an early development stage; their higher trade latency, lower liquidity, and less intuitive user interfaces make them less attractive for mainstream retail users. However, as centralized exchanges continue to experience security exploits and delay the listing of new cryptocurrencies, more users will elect to adopt decentralized exchanges despite their high friction. It is worthwhile to invest in the development and growth of the decentralized exchange ecosystem to promote liquidity in an increasingly diverse token ecosystem, greater user control of cryptocurrencies, more privacy features, and lower risk of censorship.

## Sound Money (sanum pecuniam)
## By [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld)
## Posted January 6, 2019

## Foreword

I wrote this series, "Planting Bitcoin", to paint the origin story of Bitcoin leading up to the 10 year anniversary (10/31/2018). I felt that this story hadn't been told in a comprehensive and easy to read manner. I'd like to thank [Jill Carlson](https://medium.com/u/2ccb8f2dd2ba) for incepting this idea on the road trip back from Tahoe in early 2018.

## Introduction

Bitcoin's origin is akin to planting a tree. It wasn't just Satoshi's selection of the species (code), but the season (timing), soil (distribution), and gardening (community) that were essential to its success. It had to grow to be strong, mighty, and huge. It had to survive droughts, storms, and predators. Its deep roots had to support the weight of becoming a new world reserve currency.

## What is Money

Money is most easily defined as the medium in which value is transferred. But Money is not just paper in your hand; or numbers in your bank account, Money represents something much more fundamental:

* Money is a primitive form of [memory](http://pricesandmarkets.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Luther-Olson-4.pdf) or record-keeping. It is the collective memory of who has the ability to allocate wealth.
* Money, which is the representation of the work required to acquire goods and services, can also be viewed as [stored energy](https://blog.picks.co/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3).
* Money is the central information utility of the world economy. As a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account, money is the critical vessel of information about the conditions of markets.

The main functions of money are Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). No money starts by providing all three functions, each new species of money follows a distinct evolutionary path that we will cover later. Let's first start by identifying the newest species of money, Bitcoin.

## Species

"These protocols can't be described comprehensively as static objective things. They're best thought of as live systems" — [Ari Paul](https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1053007190552956928)

Bitcoin is a new form of life, a new species of money called "cryptocurrency." More importantly, it is "sound money," or using proper taxonomy, "sanum pecuniam." Sound money is [defined](http://www.aei.org/publication/sound-money-vs-stable-money/) as money that has a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments and political parties which is essential for individual freedom.

"I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/6/#selection-209.0-221.16)

The code of life is written into an organism at its inception. Satoshi carefully architected Bitcoin's DNA, or genetic code, to be the best sound money ever created. We can think of Bitcoin's genetic code as representing instructions that have been written to incentivize the organization and coordination of cellular function.

"I believe I've worked through all those little details over the last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them"- [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/15/#selection-111.0-113.67)

Bitcoin's genetic code:

* Satoshi needed a way for the Bitcoin to spark itself into existence, so he coded in its DNA a fixed supply (21M Bitcoins). An increase in Bitcoin's price inevitably leads to a corresponding increase in participants (users), security (mining), and developers. This becomes a self-reinforcing [feedback loop](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562).
* Bitcoin's mining function, Proof of Work (PoW) is both its metabolism and defense mechanism. Bitcoin [eats energy](https://blog.picks.co/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3) to generate new coins and build digital walls to protect the network. PoW also makes Bitcoin anti-fragile, or in other words, as it grows larger, it becomes more resistant to attack.
* A new Bitcoin block is found every 10 minutes, this genetic code enables Bitcoin's cells to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other despite enormous distances. It is the [internal clock](https://grisha.org/blog/2018/01/23/explaining-proof-of-work/) that sets the metabolic rate.

"It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can see its code and see exactly what it does. It can't be changed. It can't be argued with. It can't be tampered with. It can't be corrupted. It can't be stopped. It can't even be interrupted. If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue to live, uncorrupted." — [Ralph Merkle](https://mobile.twitter.com/SauceryCoin/status/1049184561974800384)

Bitcoin's genetic code manifests itself via traits (characteristics of an organism) that may or may not be visible.

## Traits

In biology, a trait or character is a feature of an organism. According to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, organisms that possess heritable traits that enable them to better adapt to their environment compared with other members of their species will be more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass more of their genes on to the next generation.

Money is no different. Money has traits that enable it to survive and thrive as a Store of Value (SoV), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Unit of Account (UoA). Bitcoin is a new species that has vastly superior traits to its predecessors. Below we dive deeper into those traits between different species of money.

![Traits of money chart](/assets/images/cy19q1/dan-held-traits.png){: .align-center}*Bitcoin’s birth introduced two new traits, “Openly programmable” and “Decentralized”*




_(The sections below, on the attributes that make for a sound money, are largely borrowed from_ [_Vijay Boyapati_](https://medium.com/u/9efdc740067f) _'s article "_ [_The Bullish Case for Bitcoin_](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) _")_

## Verifiable

Fiat currencies and gold are fairly easy to verify for authenticity. However, despite providing features on their banknotes to prevent counterfeiting, nation-states and their citizens still face the potential to be duped by counterfeit bills. Gold is also not immune from being counterfeited. Sophisticated criminals have used [gold-plated tungsten](http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/ottawa/fake-gold-wafer-rbc-canadian-mint-1.4368801) as a way of fooling gold investors into paying for false gold. Bitcoins, on the other hand, can be verified with absolute mathematical certainty.

## Fungible

Gold provides the standard for fungibility. When melted down, an ounce of gold is [nearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_fingerprinting) indistinguishable from any other ounce. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, are only as fungible as the issuing institutions allow them to be. While it may be the case that a fiat banknote is usually treated like any other by merchants accepting them, there are instances where large-denomination notes have been treated differently to small ones. For instance, India's government, in an attempt to stamp out India's untaxed gray market, completely demonetized their 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes. Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, meaning that every bitcoin, when transmitted, is treated the same on the Bitcoin network. However, because bitcoins are traceable on the blockchain, a particular bitcoin may become tainted by its use in illicit trade and merchants or exchanges may be compelled not to accept such tainted bitcoins. Despite this, there is no alternative pricing for "tainted Bitcoins" so it remains highly fungible.

## Portable

Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man. A single USB stick can contain a billion dollars, easily carried anywhere, transmitted near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital, are also highly portable. However, governments can control the free flow of capital. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself (It cost Germany $9.1 million to [repatriate](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045) their gold).

## Durable

Gold is the king of durability — the vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains today and will for near eternity (it can only be destroyed through nuclear transmutation). While fiat currency exists both in physical and digital forms, we will only consider the durability of its digital form... the durability of the institution that issues them. Many fiat issuing governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them. If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term — the US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability. However, there are encouraging signs that the network displays a remarkable degree of "[anti-fragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) ."

## Divisible

Bitcoins can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts. Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice. Gold, while physically divisible, becomes difficult to use when divided into small enough quantities that it could be useful for lower-value day-to-day trade.

## Scarce

The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined absolute scarcity: only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created (the number of units is arbitrary, as Bitcoins can be subdivided into 210 quadrillion satoshis). This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (ex: [sea-floor](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/deep-sea-mining-five-facts/) or [asteroid mining](http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/solutions/asteroids.html)). Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nation-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems.

## Established history

No monetary good has a history as long and storied as gold, which has been valued for as long as human civilization has existed. Coins minted in the distant days of antiquity [still maintain significant value today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoxne_Hoard) . The same cannot be said of fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent anomaly of history. From their inception, fiat currencies have had a near-universal tendency toward eventual worthlessness. The use of inflation as an insidious means of invisibly taxing a citizenry has been a temptation that no states in history have been able to resist. Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society's confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. The [median](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) age of a human is ~30 years old, which means Bitcoin has been around for nearly 33.3% of the average human life. If Bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.


## Censorship resistant

One of the most significant sources of early demand for bitcoins was their use in the illicit drug trade. Silk Road was a testament to this resistance. The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for proscribed activities is that it is "permissionless" at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant. This is in stark contrast to the fiat banking system, where states regulate banks and the other gatekeepers of money transmission to report and prevent outlawed uses of monetary goods. A classic example of regulated money transmission is capital controls. A wealthy millionaire, for instance, may find it very hard to transfer their wealth to a new domicile if they wish to flee an oppressive regime (Russian assets in the UK being frozen). Although gold is not issued by states, its physical nature makes it difficult to transmit at distance, making it far more susceptible to state regulation than Bitcoin. India's [Gold Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold_%28Control%29_Act,_1968) is an example of such regulation. If your mission is to disrupt central banks, you need to have sovereign level censorship resistance.

"Bitcoin's advantages lie not in its speed, convenience, or friendly user experience. Bitcoin's value comes from it having an immutable monetary policy precisely because nobody can easily change it" — [Saifedean Ammous](https://medium.com/u/becf6824fd89)

### Unforgeable Costliness

Money that is costly to create. Due either to its original cost (gold mining) or the improbability of its history (art) — and that it is difficult to fake this costliness. Bitcoin's PoW ensures the cost to mine a Bitcoin is near equivalent to how much it would cost to purchase one on an exchange. The [unforgeable costliness](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/08/) pattern includes the following basic steps:

"(1) find or create a class of objects that is highly improbable, takes much effort to make, or both, _and_ such that the measure of their costliness can be verified by other parties.

(2) use the objects to enable a protocol or institution to cross trust boundaries"
- Nick Szabo

### Openly Programmable

Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, it is usable by anyone/anywhere/anytime. Developers can freely program applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol without having to ask anyone for permission.

"It is dynamic, upgradable and extendable. It does not need throwing out and replacing with each new iteration, it will continuously improve." — [Neil Woodfine](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/981435332506906626)

### Decentralized

In it's simplest definition, decentralization means a lack of centralized control. Or the degree to which an entity within the system can resist coercion and still function as part of the system. Coercion doesn't necessarily mean force, it means negative incentives to align with an authority. Decentralization is an important trait for money because any centralized control could threaten any one of the other traits (especially [scarcity](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation/Cumulative_Inflation_by_Decade.asp) and [censorship resistance](https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/compliance-and-shared-services/financial-crime-compliance/sanctions-solutions/sanctions-screening))

Decentralization is also important because it enables greater [social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html) . The challenge is that [natural systems](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004829&type=printable) inherently evolve towards centralization (hierarchies). We see this emergent property in cryptocurrencies as well. Hierarchy is an emergent property of networks. When we consider more complex systems, we must contend with more [complex relationships](https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis/status/1029217138601418753) between the layers. Quantifying decentralization is an especially [thorny](https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/1048786254245126144) issue.

Decentralization is such a misunderstood concept, because people apply it to a whole system, when really it needs to be applied to multiple layers within the system: The Protocol, The Politics and The Practical. — Sarah Lewis

### Evolution

For a species of money to survive, it needs to be competitive on every attribute and be exceptionally better on a few of them. Attributes don't sum, they multiply.

When Gold was first introduced, the bead makers (an example of a more primitive form of money) probably tried to convince the ignorant population that gold was no substitute for beads. But it turned out that gold had traits that were more advantageous. It did not matter what anyone thought. Gold was destined to be a more powerful currency than shells or beads.

The fact that gold has remained a valued commodity for thousands of years speaks to the importance of these specific traits. In fact, the combination of traits possessed by gold and other precious metals eventually provided the foundation for the next evolution in money, fiat currency. In money's next evolution of species, fiat currency fulfilled several critical traits to an even greater degree than gold. Paper was more portable and could be more easily transacted. That is not to say it was entirely superior. In many cases, fiat currencies lacked durability, and as we will see, would eventually become less and less scarce (due to inflation) The critical flaw: its supply was controlled by kings and governments and increasingly used as a tool to wield power and control. Upon every new iteration of species, they each evolve in the following four stages (taken from "[The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)"):

1. **Collectible**. In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.
2. **Store of value**: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.
3. **Medium of exchange**: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange.
4. **Unit of account**. When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods.

### Survival and Extinction

Extinction can most simply be described as the failure of a species to compete in an environment to such at a degree that it eventually ceases to exist. The inability to compete itself may be the result of two primary causes; increased competition from superior species or a dramatic change in environment.

"Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection originated to provide an evidence-based explanation of the past. We now leverage this theory to look forward and understand its implications on the future of currency. Given the ever-changing conditions of the future, will gold and fiat currencies continue to compete or go the way of the dinosaur?" — Ryan Walker "[On the Origins of Money: Darwin and the Evolution of Cryptocurrency](https://www.coindesk.com/origins-money-darwin-evolution-cryptocurrency/)"

According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by [DollarDaze.org](http://dollardaze.org/) the average life expectancy of a fiat currency is 27 years. The study also indicated the most common causes of any given currencies extinction are hyperinflation, monetary reform, war and independence. Looking towards the fittest of fiat currencies, those that become reserve currencies, we find that most last just under 100 years. (Note: US currency only starts from 1933 because USD was redeemable for gold prior to that)

![World Currency Status](/assets/images/cy19q1/dan-held-currency-status.png){: .align-center}*JPM, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, December 2011*


With fiat currencies being so susceptible to failure, gold has long served as an alternative as it is more scarce and durable. In terms of scarcity, fiat currencies can be printed and inflated at the will of their authorities.

"While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problems it purports to solve — namely, providing a form of money that is under the full command of its owner and likely to hold its value in the long run — are as old as human society itself" — [Saifedean Ammous](https://medium.com/u/becf6824fd89)

The currencies are in a state of hyper-evolution as they continue to take on a varied array of distinctive traits that set them apart from one another within their own competitive ecosystem (fiat/crypto).

Equally as threatening to traditional forms of money, the conditions of the environment in which currencies compete is in a constant state of change. Undertones of growing distrust in centralized entities encourage populations to consider alternative stores of value.

Sovereignty, once a trait that was necessary for the survival of a currency, may now be falling out of favor. Centralized failures such as the US financial crisis of 2008 or hyper-inflated fiat currencies such as Zimbabwe dollars or Argentinian pesos compound these sentiments. The most profound of these conditions is the growing awareness throughout the world that decentralized trust is possible.

Instead of becoming anti-fragile, which is the property of growing stronger in a volatile and stressful environment, central banks have removed danger and mortality from failure, which causes competition to stagnate or degrade.

Sometimes stressors are so strong that they are fatal for a species of money. While this is devastating for the money itself, the population comprised of those that survive are fitter on average. This isn't because any of the survivors grew stronger from the stress, but simply because the weaker monies were removed.

"We humans regularly underestimate high-impact, [long-tail events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) . Careful consideration of long tail events is especially important in the design of a protocol that has the potential to become the backbone of the global economy" — [Hugo Nguyen](https://medium.com/u/3efc6d31e61c)

It is interesting to imagine what Charles Darwin would make of the current state of money. History would have us believe that the existence and survival of any entity, be it plant, animal, corporation, or money is subject to the laws of natural selection.

With this understanding, it is hard to imagine Darwin contesting the opinion that Bitcoin possesses the necessary traits to become the dominant species of money.

Bitcoin has been perfectly honed for its environment through its exceptional genetic code and the manifestation of that code in the form of superior traits.

Bitcoin is the apex predator of money and is constantly evolving. None of the previous monetary life forms stand a chance.

## Central Banks and the 2008 Financial Crisis
## By [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld)
## Posted January 6, 2019

"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve." — Satoshi Nakamoto

## Introduction

In my last article, "[Species](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/6/planting-bitcoinspecies-14)," I covered why Satoshi's design of Bitcoin's genetic code made it the best species of money ever created.

Satoshi had begun crafting Bitcoin's genetic code in [2007](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=13.msg46#msg46) but had waited for the right moment to plant the seed, the right moment in which the world would understand and embrace what he had created. In this article, I will dive into the moment in which Satoshi precisely chose to plant the Bitcoin seed.

## Central Banks

From the founding of the Bank of England, central banks have been used as a means for states to fund their policies without risking the popular ire caused by direct taxation. When the capital provided by central banks is misallocated by either the state or in a market distorted by artificially low interest rates, an inevitable collapse occurs. The central bank is the root of these periodic market dislocations.

> "I believe the root cause of every financial crisis, the root cause, is flawed government policies" — [Henry Paulson](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/hank-paulson-cause-of-financial-crisis_n_3822417.html) (US Treasury Secretary during the 2008 financial crisis and former Goldman Sachs CEO)

![Global Deflation](/assets/images/cy19q1/dan-held-global-deflation.png){: .align-center}*There hasn't been a year of global deflation since 1933*


With the recent market dislocation, investors were bailed out. Unfortunately, you cannot subsidize irresponsibility and expect people to become more responsible. Prior to the 20th century, ordinary people could always flee to gold to save themselves from the effects of the [failed](https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality), inflationist, policies of the central bank. This ended across much of the world in the 20th century as gold was outlawed. — [Vijay Boyapati](https://medium.com/u/9efdc740067f)

## 2008 Financial Crisis

"The problem had grown so big that the end was bound to be cataclysmic and have big social and political consequences" — Michael Lewis (Big Short)

**January**

_Fed tries to stop the housing bust_

The Federal Market Open Committee began lowering the fed funds rate (to 3.0%). There were [57 percent more foreclosures](http://www.realtor.org/rmodaily.nsf/pages/News2008022602) than 12 months earlier

**February**

_Bush signs tax rebate as home sales continue to plummet_

**February 13**: President [Bush signed a tax rebate](https://www.thebalance.com/bush-economic-stimulus-package-3305782) bill to help the struggling housing market. The bill increased limits for [FHA loans](https://www.thebalance.com/fha-loan-basics-315656) and allowed [Freddie Mac](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-freddie-mac-3305985) to repurchase jumbo loans.

**March**

_Fed begins bailouts_

**March 14:** The Federal Reserve held its first emergency weekend meeting in 30 years.

**March 17**: The Federal Reserve announced it would guarantee [Bear Stearns](https://www.thebalance.com/bearn-stearns-collapse-and-bailout-3305613)' bad loans.

**March 18:** The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the fed funds rate by 0.75 percent to 2.25 percent. It had halved the interest rate in six months. That same day, federal regulators agreed to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on [another $200 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003018.html) in subprime mortgage debt.

**April** **—** **June**

_The Fed buys more toxic bank debt_

**June 2:** The Fed auctions totaled $1.2 trillion. In June, the Federal Reserve lent $225 billion through its Term Auction Facility.

**July**

_IndyMac bank fails_

**July 11:** The [Office of Thrift Supervision closed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/financial-crisis/full-timeline) IndyMac Bank. Los Angeles police warned angry IndyMac depositors to remain calm while they waited in line to withdraw funds from the failed bank.

**July 23:** Secretary Paulson made the Sunday talk show rounds. He explained the need for a [bailout](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-the-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-bailout-3305658) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two agencies themselves held or guaranteed [more than half of the $12 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/id/25799253) of the nation's mortgages.

**August**

**August 18:** Satoshi [registers](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-history-cryptocurrency-satoshi-nakamoto-2017-12) Bitcoin.org through [anonymousspeech.com](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=103369.msg1135218#msg1135218)

**September** _Global panic_

**September 7:** Treasury nationalizes [Fannie and Freddie](https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/07/news/companies/fannie_freddie/index.htm?eref=edition_business) and will run the two until they are strong enough to return to independent management. The [Fannie and Freddie bailout](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-the-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-bailout-3305658) initially cost taxpayers $187 billion.

**September 15:** Lehman Brothers files for chapter 11 bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history with over $600B in assets. The bankruptcy triggered a one-day drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 4.5%, the largest decline since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Later that day, [Bank of America officially announced](https://www.cnbc.com/id/26708319) it would purchase struggling Merrill Lynch for $50 billion.
"It's terrible. Death. Like a massive earthquake.'' — Kirsty McCluskey a Lehman trader in London


**September 16:** Fed buys AIG for $85 Billion. The company had insured trillions of dollars of mortgages throughout the world. If it had fallen, so would the global banking system. On that same day, the [Reserve Primary Fund](https://www.thebalance.com/reserve-primary-fund-3305671) "broke the buck." It didn't have enough cash on hand to pay out all the redemptions that were occurring.

"I asked my wife to please go to the ATM and take as much cash as she could. When she asked why, I said it was because I didn't know whether there was a chance that banks might not open." — [Mohamed El-Erian](https://www.businessinsider.com/tales-of-the-financial-crisis-2009-9) (One of the most powerful economists/leaders in finance)

**September 17:** Economy on the brink of collapse. Panic spreads. Investors withdrew a record $144.5 billion from their money market accounts. During a typical week, only about $7 billion is withdrawn. If it had continued, businesses couldn't get money to fund their day-to-day operations. In just a few weeks, shippers wouldn't have had the cash to deliver food to grocery stores.

**October** _Bailouts_

**October 3:** Bitcoin whitepaper PDF likely [created](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/20081003-nakamoto-bitcoindraft.pdf) (not the first time it was written, but the first time it was prepared for publishing)

The same day, the [bank bailout bill](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-the-bank-bailout-bill-3305675) allowed Treasury to buy shares of troubled banks. It was the fastest way to inject capital into the frozen financial system. Despite this, global stock markets continue to collapse.

"Just as our politics are falling apart, our portfolios are falling apart, too." — Ben Hunt

**October 7:** The Federal Reserve agreed to issue short-term loans for businesses that couldn't get them elsewhere, to the tune of $1.7 Trillion.

**October 13:** Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sits down with 9 major bank CEOs. The total bailout package looks more like $2.25 trillion, well more than the original $700 billion available.

"September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression" — Ben Bernanke

**October 14:** The governments of the EU, [Japan](https://www.thebalance.com/japan-s-economy-recession-effect-on-u-s-and-world-3306007), and the United States again took unprecedented [coordinated action](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/creditcrunch-marketturmoil1) . The EU committed to spending $1.8 trillion to guarantee bank financing, buy shares to prevent banks from failing, and take any other steps needed to get banks to lend to each other again. This was after the UK committed $88 billion to purchase shares in failing banks and $438 billion to guarantee loans. In a show of solidarity, the Bank of Japan agreed to [lend unlimited dollars](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2008/10/15/17051/boj-offers-unlimited-dollars-to-banks/) .

## **October 31:** Satoshi publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper

Walking on the street in a city Satoshi looks around and notices a businesswoman on her blackberry, hailing a cab. He passes a newspaper stand and sees Miley Cyrus' (known as Hannah Montana) controversial photos in [Vanity Fair](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-pop-culture-moments-of-2008/), she's 15.

George Bush's approval rating is at a record low of 21%, Congress is at 10% — just above its all-time low. Lehman Brothers had just collapsed a month prior.

"Is now the time? Is the world ready?" Satoshi thought to himself. He had spent the last few years coding up Bitcoin then writing the whitepaper. He had patiently waited to release it to the world, but the moment had to be right... there was only one shot at this. "Is the whitepaper easy enough to read? I want to make sure this resonates with the cypherpunks, I'm hoping _cash_ will be most understandable to the other members on the mailing list who have previously created e-currencies."

"When the moment is ripe, a fanatic leader galvanizes the ripe population and pushes it to a point of no return. The leader translates the ideals published by the "men of words [cypherpunks]" into doctrines [whitepaper] promising sudden and spectacular change." — _Eric Hoffer, author of "_ [_The True Believer_](https://www.tonysheng.com/mass-movement) _" (via_ [_Tony Sheng_](https://medium.com/u/be4506861043) _)_

He returned to his home and reviewed the whitepaper for any glaring mistakes the 47th time, he couldn't find any. He leaned back and stared at the wall. He realized this was the moment, it was time to plant the seed. He popped open his e-mail client, checked the draft e-mail to the cryptographer (cypherpunk) e-mailing list and pressed send. There was no going back.

"Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe — a catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve." — [Vijay Boyapati](https://medium.com/u/9efdc740067f)

With the 2008 financial crisis, trust had been lost in a world that ran on trust.

Bitcoin was launched in a time of absolute necessity, Satoshi planted the seed at precisely the right moment.



# [Planting Bitcoin — Soil (3/4)](https://medium.com/@danhedl/planting-bitcoin-soil-3-4-d3cd47fcfa3a)
## By [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld)
## Posted January 6, 2019

## Introduction

In my last article, "[Season](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/6/planting-bitcoin-seasonnbsp24)," I covered the precise moment in which Satoshi planted Bitcoin, the 2008 Financial Crisis. In this article, I cover the Cypherpunks or the "Soil" in which he planted the Bitcoin seed giving it the best chance for survival.

## Cypherpunks

Sending the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list on October 31, 2008 was the obvious choice. This was the right group to gather feedback from, the right channel to engage with. The list was predominately populated by the [Cypherpunks](https://www.coindesk.com/the-rise-of-the-cypherpunks/) * who were activists advocating widespread use of strong cryptography, as a route to social and political change.

_*"Cypherpunks" is a play on the word 'cipher' or 'cypher', for encryption; and cyberpunk a genre of sci-fi._

The group was originally comprised of Eric Hughes, Tim May, and John Gilmore. At first, the meetings were in-person meetings in the San Francisco Bay Area, but they decided to expand the group via the cryptographer mailing list which would allow them to reach other Cypherpunks. The mailing list was a place to exchange ideas freely through the use of encryption methods, such as PGP, to ensure complete privacy. The basic ideas behind this movement can be found in the [Cypherpunk manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) written by Eric Hughes in 1993. The key principle which underpins the manifesto is the importance of privacy and finality in transactions — [PetriB](https://medium.com/@Petri.basson)

"Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system." — [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)

We want the ability to ensure that others cannot use the information in the history of our transactions [against us](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2018/07/16/payment-systems-and-privacy) . For example: a purchase indicating that someone is wealthy, an embarrassing purchase, or one that would make you subject to spam or harassment. We do not want our financial purchase to haunt us further down the road. We want an endpoint beyond which we do not have to worry about further contingencies. **In the world of payments, this is closely related to the concept of "finality**" — ideally we want to be able to state with certainty that at some point the payment has been made, the debt has been cleared, and the funds are secure. But recent developments have increased the ability for more powerful parties to clawback funds (via trusted third parties, legal funds, etc).

We hope that existing laws would provide protection against these difficulties. However, we can remove that moral hazard by not having to trust third parties or more powerful adversaries which can revert transactions solely based on their capabilities. This is what the Cypherpunks were fighting for with cryptography. They were the "[Men of words](https://www.tonysheng.com/mass-movement)," or anti-establishment intellectuals that laid the foundation for individuals like Satoshi to come along.

"The words of **anti-establishment intellectuals sow the seeds for revolution** . They present ideas and sometimes discredit the establishment, **paving the way for a charismatic leader to package their thinking into a movement** ." — [Tony Sheng](https://medium.com/@tonysheng)

Elliot Alderson, the "Cypherpunk" in the fictional show "Mr. Robot." He joins a group that aims to destroy all debt records by encrypting the financial data of the largest conglomerate in the world, E Corp.

Elliot Alderson, the "Cypherpunk" in the fictional show "Mr. Robot." He joins a group that aims to destroy all debt records by encrypting the financial data of the largest conglomerate in the world, E Corp.

The first attempts at making an anonymous transacting system were made by Cypherpunks on that cryptographer mailing list, including:

* Adam Back, the inventor of [hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), the proof-of-work (PoW) system used by several anti-spam systems. A similar PoW system is used in bitcoin
* Nick Szabo, designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called "bit gold." Bit gold was never implemented, but has been called "a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture"
* Wei Dai, who published "b-money", an "anonymous, distributed electronic cash system"
* Hal Finny, who created the first reusable proof of work system before Bitcoin (And in January 2009 he became Bitcoin network's first transaction recipient). He was also a developer of the secure communication method known as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
* David Chaum, founded DigiCash (1989) as a form of centralized "electronic money" that deployed the same kinds of cryptographic protocols — public key cryptography — that support the nature of bitcoin transactions. It is often called "Chaumian eCash."

Satoshi cites many of these Cypherpunks in the Bitcoin whitepaper and references their influence on Bitcoin's development in public statements made post code launch.

"Bitcoin is an implementation of **Wei Dai's b-money** proposal... and **Nick Szabo's Bitgold** proposal" — [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=342.msg4508#msg4508)

In fact, Satoshi thought he was late to cryptocurrency! While the Cypherpunks had attempted many times to genetically code a species of money that would survive, none had been successful.

"A lot of people **automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's** . I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9493)

He had written the whitepaper to fit his target audience, the Cypherpunks. That's why he uses the words "electronic cash", "proof-of-work," etc. which was previously used terminology in the other Cypherpunk whitepapers. He uses an ecommerce example to make it easier for everyone to comprehend. He's crafting a narrative that will resonate with the Cypherpunks, to get them interested and involved. **Bitcoin was the holy grail** **—** **it had solved the problem of finality and provided a small measure of privacy.** The source code implementation was his product spec.

"The **functional details** are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014863.html)

The following things not described in the whitepaper, but are included in the source code: 21M hard cap, 10 minute blocks, 1 MB block caps. Those were incredibly important components of Bitcoin. The whitepaper was merely a teaser.

"If the Bitcoin Whitepaper is the **Declaration of Independence**, the Source Code is the **Constitution**" — [Pierre Rochard](https://medium.com/u/1206face71fc)

In true Cypherpunk fashion, the publication of Satoshi's whitepaper (October 2008) was quickly followed by code release in January 2009. The notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list.

" **Cypherpunks write code** . We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. **We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it** . Our code is free for all to use, worldwide... **We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down** ." — A Cypherpunk's Manifesto

Importantly, Satoshi didn't [premine](https://blog.picks.co/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892) any Bitcoins. Satoshi gave the Cypherpunks a two month heads up before mining the Genesis block. To prove fairness, he included a proof of no [premine timestamp](https://blog.picks.co/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892) in the [Genesis Block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) of the Bitcoin blockchain. It carried a strong political message. What he was trying to accomplish was clear — they were building a new financial system. Bitcoin wasn't merely digital cash, it was an alternative to banks.

## By [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld)
## Posted January 6, 2019

## Introduction

In my last article, "[Soil](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/6/planting-bitcoinsoil-34)," I covered the Cypherpunks or the "Soil" in which he planted the Bitcoin seed giving it the best chance for survival.

Satoshi's design of Bitcoin's genetic code made it the best species of money ever created, he waited for exactly the right moment to plant the seed, and had planted it in the most fertile soil. Now it was time to nurture Bitcoin's development.

## Early Development

> "The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1735.msg26999#msg26999)

Satoshi chose to be anonymous, which fit the ethos of the Cypherpunks. **People can project hopes and dreams on an anonymous individual, ensuring maximal narrative fit** . That's why a book is often better than the movie. His anonymity was a critical component of the founder story — dev worship is a dangerous thing for an open source project aiming for decentralization. Volunteers need to rely on trusting the objective reality of the code, rather than focusing on the merits of the project leader.

> "It is high time for everyone involved in BTC to stop concerning themselves with the question of the identity of Nakamoto, and accept that **it does not matter to the operation of the technology, in the same way that the identity of the inventor of the wheel no longer matters**"- [Saifedean Ammous](https://medium.com/@saifedean)

As a subtle jab to central banks, and as a nod to his admiration of the gold standard, **he** [**chose**](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto) **his birthday (on his p2p foundation website profile) as the date the US made gold ownership illegal** through Executive Order 6102, April 5th. And he [chose](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto) 1975 as his year of birth which is the year when the US citizens were allowed to own gold again.

> "[with Bitcoin] **we can win a major battle in the arms race** and gain a new territory of freedom for several years." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014823.html)

In his public statements, he usually focused on ordinary, mainstream, users, with his tone sometimes even excited in suggesting many ways bitcoin could be made more convenient or useful for commerce or other things. Satoshi was practical, which made interactions very easy and comfortable. He tended to avoid philosophical discussions and political arguments.

Additionally, Satoshi took steps to signal to the Cypherpunks, and future members, that Bitcoin wasn't a scam. The conservative deescalation of his mining contributions, never spending any of his coins, nor using his influence for any purpose, shows that he wanted the world to make up their own mind about his project and judge it on its own terms. **And unlike every other founder in history, Satoshi never cashed out.**

> "Bitcoin benefited from an extremely rare set of circumstances. Because it launched in a world where digital cash had no established value, they circulated freely. That can't be recaptured today since everyone expects coins to have value. Not only was it fair, but it was historically unique in its fairness. The immaculate conception." [Nic Carter](https://medium.com/@nic__carter)

**Many of the early Cypherpunks became core developers in the Bitcoin protocol like Hal Finney and Adam Bach.** The caliber of the early development team attracted talented (soon to be "core") developers.

> "Gifted people tend to want to work with other top people and work on something that matters, that they believe in. **Motivation matters** . Protocol design and coding is partly an artistic, aesthetic endeavour; people do their best work on a mission: uncensorable global internet money" — Adam Bach

## **The Gardener Leaves**

Satoshi showed a great level of restraint and took a long-term perspective on issues, as when Satoshi resisted the calls for bitcoin to market itself as a funding mechanism for Wikileaks after PayPal famously froze its account. This, Satoshi argued, would only bring down legal and regulatory hammers that much faster. Satoshi recognized the need to carefully cultivate Bitcoin.

> "I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and **the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage** ." — Satoshi Nakamoto

The connection to Wikileaks at such an early stage, at the height of what could be called public resistance against the Iraq war, probably gave Bitcoin a very different dimension. So he did not mince his words nor hide his intention for leaving in what can be called the last public statement where he says the US government was headed towards Bitcoin.

> "It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and **the swarm is headed towards us** ." — [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.msg29280#msg29280)

In April 2011, Gavin Andressen notified Satoshi that he was meeting with the CIA. **Any further involvement might give away his identity which would endanger the long-term success of the project** . Bitcoin now had enough support that he could walk away, and so he did.

> "Satoshi left because he didn't want its influence to affect the protocol development creating a single point of failure. The very idea of "Satoshi Vision" itself is against Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin" — [Frederico Tenga](https://mobile.twitter.com/FedericoTenga/status/1019726734210555904)

## **Social Scalability**

Satoshi was able to walk away because Bitcoin had trust minimization baked into the protocol. This is what made it socially scalable.

> "Power and scale breed conflict and corruption, that the purest part of any revolution is the beginning." — [Dhruv Bansal](https://medium.com/@shrubvandal)

It is easy to start with good intentions, however as things scale that becomes harder and harder to maintain. **Bitcoin was specially architected to be trust minimized** . Satoshi set it up so that there is no one person or group whose power can be coveted, usurped, or broken.

> "Bitcoin is a social breakthrough, not a technological one" — Alex Hardy

**Bitcoin needed to be the universal language for money** . You are communicating with strangers worldwide, which you neither know nor trust that agree you own an abstraction of value.

> "Bitcoin is a distributed incentive structure we collectively engineer and freely opt-into. It's political technology, the first of its kind. This leaderless-ness is one part of what gives Bitcoin — in particular, beyond other cryptocurrencies today — such robustness." — [Dhruv Bansal](https://medium.com/@shrubvandal)

## **HODLing, the Hero's Journey**

> "In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot." — Mark Twain

Satoshi built Bitcoin for the believers in a new financial system, the HODLers, the revolutionaries. The ones who were disenfranchised with the existing financial system. The ones who would be attracted by the prospect of sudden and spectacular change in their life.

We must heed the call for a Hero's Journey (the HODLer) that is rooted in HODL. **It's not just a meme, it is representative of foundational values upon which stronger cultural memes are eventually developed** . This supports Bitcoin's cultural foundation.

> "Over and over again, the financial system was, in some narrow way, discredited....The rebellion by American youth against the money culture never happened." — Big Short

The Hero at the beginning of their Journey has values that do not agree with the values that the Hero ends up with at Journey's end. That is the entire point of undertaking the Journey, but is also what makes it so frightening. **The Hero must let go of his/her former self in the pursuit of this transformed version of themselves.** The Journey's end is unknown, but what is known is that the Journey inspires the acquisition of new knowledge, the relinquishing of outdated paradigms and the abandoning of the familiar.The HODL Journey in Bitcoin sketches a map that becomes clearer with the acquisition of knowledge.

Satoshi needed to bootstrap the network with an incentive mechanism — the block reward which (a) controlled currency supply of Bitcoin and (b) created an incentive for people to participate in the network. **Each cycle brings aboard a new set of true believers; a new set of HODLers** . They, in their turn, become strong advocates for the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value. Contagious Freedom. [Vijay Boyapati](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati)

> " **Hodling bootstrapped Bitcoin into existence.** Hodling increases value, which increases demand, hash rate, and network security, which, in turn, attracts new hodlers and devs. This self-reinforcing feedback loop drives Bitcoin's network effects, security, and value." — [@TobiasAHuber](https://twitter.com/TobiasAHuber)

Satoshi had encoded in Bitcoin DNA a mechanism to incentivize the participants, through the shared belief in Bitcoin manifested via HODLing.

> "In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. I **t has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.**" — [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562)

Early HODLers believed in Bitcoin despite overwhelming negativity and false information (ex: labeled as a currency for money launderers and drug dealers, price fluctuations). HODLers had stronger risk appetite to weather the volatility of being a first mover. They're practitioners of skin in the game.

**In terms of the Hero's Journey, "HODL!" is the mentor's advice to the Hero in his Journey** . Its roots are firmly based on the futility of trying to beat the market (Efficient Market Hypothesis and Hayekian Distributed information both dictate that the market can't be systematically outperformed).

The increase in Bitcoin's price has corresponding virality. And as it expands, HODLing becomes popular with people with a lower risk appetite, pulling in more and more network effect into the Bitcoin black hole — [Dan McArdle](https://medium.com/@robustus)

Via the Lindy Effect, the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society's confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. **It slowly seeps further into the psyche of those in charge.**

> "Protocols die when they run out of believers." — [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval)

The faith in a new financial system is what binds everything together. Bitcoin is not just a software project. It's a method of coordination for a large group of people who face powerful adversaries. Bitcoin isn't just a technological breakthrough, it's also a social one.

> "When people are ripe for a mass movement, they are usually ripe for any effective movement, and not solely with a particular doctrine or program. All mass movements are competitive, and the gain of one in adherents is the loss of all the others....A stable and sustainable ideology must be the foundation of all cryptocurrencies. **No amount of cryptography, or consensus protocol development will help a cryptocurrency with an unstable and bankrupt ideology. Stable ideologies allow communities to thrive**". [Kay Kurokawa](https://medium.com/@kaykurokawa)

A simple example in religion is the Christian tenet that "there is one true god". This belief strengthens the religion because it weakens membership in competing religions. **Communities with unstable ideologies will eventually collapse.**

> "Unlike Bitcoin, nobody needs to explain why gold is valuable. Gold is simple. Bitcoin is complicated. So in the long run, the argument goes, Bitcoin can never replace gold... It's true that the stories we tell matter, but those stories can change. **Stories don't win over everything. Eventually, raw utility supplants tradition. Bitcoin is a serious improvement over gold and starts to displace its role, the market will respond and re-price accordingly**... To the digital native of the future, Bitcoin wallets will probably seem more natural than vaults full of useless metals painstakingly drilled out of the earth." — [Haseeb Qureshi](https://hackernoon.com/we-already-know-blockchains-killer-apps-f2d443eba35)

**Money is a winner-take-all technology, driven by network effects.** The crypto with the most HODLers, therefore, is the most demanded by consumers and will be the ultimate winner.

> "Bitcoin is digital gold in the eyes of [HODLers]. To some extent this group already operates on a Bitcoin Standard: investments are evaluated on their ability to yield a return in Bitcoin." [Tuur Demeester](https://medium.com/@tuurdemeester)

HODL forces us to extend our gaze beyond the present. It forces our present selves to contend with an alternate reality. **HODL asks us to reconfigure our present set of preferences to permit the consideration of a future Bitcoin-based digital economy.**

HODL is a noble basis for a Journey. Through the sacrifice of current consumption, **HODLing is a net benefit for everyone as it increases every coin's purchasing power.**

> "No Hero fights alone; All for one, one for all. Your call to HODL need not be the same as mine; indeed, they can be very different. Yet, in the end, they all redound to the benefit of each other." — [Prateek Goorha](https://medium.com/@goorha)

Bitcoin promises an alternative for citizens across the world to keep their savings in a form of money that can neither be confiscated nor diluted. If Bitcoin grows much larger, it may force governments to become a voluntary organization. **Through HODLing, we may finally be free.**

> "The secret to happiness is freedom; the secret to freedom is courage" — Thucydides

Those who opt-in to Bitcoin, are trading something abundant for something scarce, **trading the past for the future, trading financial dependence for financial sovereignty.**

## Conclusion

Satoshi architected the perfect genetic code necessary to a new species of money, Bitcoin. He then waited for the precise moment to plant the new species, the 2008 Financial Crisis. At that moment, he distributed the whitepaper to the only group that cared — the Cypherpunks. And finally, he nurtured Bitcoin to a stage where it no longer needed him.

**Many digital cash systems came and went over the years before Bitcoin and after Bitcoin** . Most were just whitepapers, some wrote and developed code, some even built a community, but it will be extremely difficult to repeat the success of Bitcoin's planting.

## Exploring market share capture in cryptocurrencies
## By [Misir Mahmudov](https://blog.goodaudience.com/@misir_mahmudov) and [Yassmine Elmandjra](https://twitter.com/yassineARK)
## Posted January 7, 2019

This series will explore how the winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most notion applies to the cryptocurrency market. In Part I, we will provide a high-level overview on the evolution of monetary systems up to the inception of cryptocurrencies, shedding light on the limitations of previous forms of money. In Part II, we will explain why the clear winner, likely Bitcoin, should capture most, if not all cryptocurrency market share. In Part III, we will apply this reasoning to the global economy and determine the extent to which the cryptocurrency market may capture a share of global base money.

### Part I: The Quest for a Global Money

Before the rise of any universal monetary standards, barter was a common means of direct exchange. Subject to the problem of coincidence of wants, civilization came to understand the impracticability of barter. In an attempt to provide a solution to this impracticality, indirect exchange emerged and was made possible with intermediary goods such as seashells, glass beads, and cattle. Over time, modern technologies (like mass utilization of hydrocarbon fuel energy and importation) considerably advanced manufacturing and transportation, making the world increasingly connected. Exploration and intercontinental trade became more prevalent, and the standard traits of money evolved to accommodate a more global context. This ultimately undermined existing media of exchange, as the lack of absolute scarcity and low costs of production could not provide money guarantees and were exploited by increasingly advanced technologies. Specifically, outside groups learned how to easily reproduce region-specific forms of money. Unaware of the absolute abundance of their money, nations suffered severe wealth dilution. [1]

As the limitations in existing forms of money began to manifest, specific properties of monetary goods emerged that better fulfilled money's store of value and medium of exchange functionalities, including scarcity, durability, portability, fungibility, verifiability, divisibility, and established history. Through a process of monetary natural selection, goods competed with each other based on these demanded attributes and in the 19th century, the world converged to gold as the global monetary standard.

With the rise of gold, other forms of commodity money took form. Silver as a money was popularized because of the high costs associated with using gold in day-to-day trade. Silver's lower value per unit weight relative to gold made it easier to use for smaller transactions. [2] For centuries, the gold to silver ratio remained between 12 and 15 and was recognized as the bimetallic standard. But this bimetallic standard ended up as nothing but a temporary phenomenon adopted to overcome insufficient technology. With the introduction of paper money backed by gold, which gave people the ability to trade any amount of value represented in gold terms, silver's monetary role was subsequently reduced. The graph below shows how rapidly the gold to silver ratio soared after the popularization of paper money.


![Gold and Silver Correlation Chart](/assets/images/cy19q1/gold-and-silver-correlation.png){: .align-center}*Gold / Silver Ratio [https://www.goldbroker.com/news/gold-and-silver-correlation-988](https://www.goldbroker.com/news/gold-and-silver-correlation-988)*


Through financialization, gold's limitations to serve as a global money began to surface. In particular, gold's physical nature and high value per unit weight made it vulnerable to centralization and its detrimental effects. With gold's lack of portability and the high friction in using a scale to measure the amount of gold in every transaction, the state intervened to establish standardized units by minting (coining) gold coins. As citizens got acclimated with the conferred legitimacy and the infrastructure built around standardized units, the state felt comfortable engaging with what is known as '[coin clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_coin_debasement)', a form of debasement whereby jurisdictions would reduce the content of gold in a coin and use the excess gold to finance expenditure at the cost of citizens.

Later, goldsmiths, who provided services for custodying precious metals, introduced promissory notes (IOUs) that were redeemable for metals. These notes (paper money) eventually became commonly used in exchange. The goldsmiths understood that they could lend out more notes than gold they had stored in their vaults because people were unlikely to simultaneously redeem their gold reserves. This practice became known as fractional reserve banking. Goldsmiths, which later became banks, issued receipts in excess of the represented metal and generated massive profits as a result.

The 18th and the 19th centuries saw the formalization of the Gold Standard as the proliferation of banknotes and the less sound nature of silver made itself known. The Gold Standard was a monetary system whereby a country's monetary supply was directly linked to the value of its gold reserves, putting a cap on a nation's ability to inflate supply. By the 20th century, states began exploiting the limitations of gold and abusing the practice of fractional reserve banking, ultimately removing its viability as a global money. The US was able to centralize gold reserves, often forcefully confiscating gold from its citizens, [3] and began printing money in excess of their underlying reserves. Instead of attempting to redeem themselves, the US under Richard Nixon cancelled the convertibility of the dollar into gold and officially abandoned the Gold Standard in 1971. Ties between gold and paper money were in turn severed, marking the beginnings of fully unbacked fiat currencies. Below is a chart of the US monetary base expansion relative to the value of US gold reserves.

### Currencies... Currencies Everywhere.

Today, there exists over 180 currencies across 195 countries. The reason for such an anomaly is simple: there is no free market for currencies. Currency markets have been restricted by governments in order to maintain financial control. There are numerous laws and institutions set up for the exact purpose of inhibiting a free market monetary system. This includes enforced borders, legal tender laws, capital controls, state decrees, seigniorage privileges, local control, local monopolies on violence, debt extinguishing laws, capital gains taxes, implicit bailout guarantees for banks, central banks and dozens of other artificial barriers. This type of legislation forces people around the world to keep using inferior currencies under the threat of direct or indirect violence or repercussions. The centralized nature of the financial system and flows allows governments and institutions to impose these restrictions and greatly limit people's ability to express their true demand for superior, more competitive currencies. Fiat money's soundness is now dependent on an authority's ability to enforce legitimate monetary policy. People living in countries like Venezuela are unable to reliably store their wealth due to hyperinflation induced by irresponsible monetary policy and limited availability of more reliable currencies due to strict capital controls. In addition, as the only form of legal tender, citizens are obliged to pay taxes in and accept the inferior currency in exchange for goods and services. The more competitive currencies, like the dollar, that do make their way into countries like Venezuela, are sold at large premiums as the high demand is not met by the controlled supply. Until recently, citizens of countries like Venezuela had no way to opt out of this system and were forced to adopt easy money.

The government's control of money has made it vulnerable to gross mismanagement. In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYhEDxFwFRU&t=1230s) in 1984, Friedrich Hayek famously said: _"I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. We can't take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop."_ And, in [Free Market Monetary System](https://mises.org/library/free-market-monetary-system) _,_ Friedrich Hayek notes that " _the monopoly of government of issuing money has not only deprived us of good money but has also deprived us of the only process by which we can find out what would be good money. We do not even quite know what exact qualities we want ... because we have never been allowed to experiment with it. We have never been given a chance to find out what the best kind of money would be."_

### Enter Bitcoin: The Experiment That Allows Us To Experiment

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed Bitcoin, an alternative financial system free from top-down control. Bitcoin, ["a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), was not created to fit existing governments and financial systems.

Bitcoin is the experiment that allows us to experiment. Unlike any money of the past, Bitcoin is borderless, permissionless, censorship-resistant, and easily verifiable. As such, Bitcoin may precisely be this "sly roundabout way" that bypasses prohibitive mechanisms and legacy financial institutions that restrict people's access to a free market for money. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold because it maintains and improves upon most of gold's properties, including scarcity and unforgeable costliness. Given its digital nature, bitcoins are easily divisible, portable and unseizable, which enables it to be much better protected from the threats of centralization and the fate experienced by gold. First introduced by [Vijay Boyapati](https://twitter.com/real_vijay?lang=en) and then further expanded upon by [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld?lang=en), below is a table assessing Bitcoin, gold and fiat's ability to fulfill the traits of money.

![Traits of money](/assets/images/cy19q1/dan-held-traits.png){: .align-center}*[https://medium.com/@danhedl/planting-bitcoin-56bd1459cb23](https://medium.com/@danhedl/planting-bitcoin-56bd1459cb23)*


### The Rise of Cryptocurrencies

[Cryptocurrencies are first and foremost money](https://tokeneconomy.co/cryptocurrencies-are-money-not-equity-30ff8d0491bb) . With the exception of a few, 'crypto-tokens' are either clearly intended to be money or are intended to be money but are obfuscated by technological jargon. As Bitcoin's community grew and its prices rose, other cryptocurrencies (often referred to as altcoins) began to hit the market. Many of these cryptocurrencies were built in an attempt to iterate and improve upon Bitcoin's "fundamental design flaws" and "limited functionality". In 2018, ten years after Bitcoin's inception, there are now over [2,000 cryptocurrencies](http://coinmarketcap.com) .

Contrary to the 20th century's locally nationalized market for money, the cryptocurrency market much better resembles a competitive private market where no coercive monopolies distort price signals by preventing competitors from entering. Given the open source nature of cryptocurrencies, anyone is free to create their own or modify existing ones, which is as simple as copying the publicly available code of an existing cryptocurrency. This in turn encourages open and inexpensive experimentation.

The open source nature of cryptocurrencies is a promising mechanism to determine what the natural money of society might be. As Jörg Guido Hülsmann highlights in the [Ethics of Money Production](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethics+of+money+production&oq=ethics+of+money+production&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j0.2838j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), _"the only way to find out the natural money of society is to let people freely associate and choose the best means of exchange out of the available alternatives."_

Assuming operation under a free market, the question then becomes to what extent the natural money captures market share. While today's world has manifested itself differently, a glimpse of a winner take most, if not all, reality was seen with gold. Assuming a long-term time horizon, this same glimpse of reality may play out with cryptocurrencies, this time as more than just a temporary phenomenon.

In Part II, we explore in depth the validity of a winner-takes-all narrative. By defining market size to be the total monetary premium of all cryptocurrencies and deriving what drives a good's monetary premium, we shed light on the merits of such a narrative.

# [Maker Dai: Stable, but not scalable](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484)

## A lesson in stablecoin arbitrage
## By [Su Zhu](https://twitter.com/zhusu) and [Hasu](https://medium.com/@hasufly)
## Posted January 7, 2019

The least understood thing about stablecoins is how they come into existence. Who creates the supply of Tether, USDC or Dai that you can buy on your favorite exchange? We will take a look at how professional arbitrageurs expand and contract the supply of a stablecoin based on the current demand of the market, how Dai's model is different and why the lack of a professional arbitrage model makes Dai fundamentally unscalable.

There's a common misconception that Dai can scale to any size, as demand for the stablecoin drives the price over $1, which leads arbitrageurs to lock up ETH (or other assets) in CDPs and create more Dai. This chain of logic is usually used to support the narrative that higher demand for Dai leads to higher demand for Ether, but both statements are wrong.

### How stablecoins scale

Let us define a stablecoin as scalable if its supply can closely track the demand to hold it. To do that, a stablecoin relies on the existence of professional arbitrageurs that react to market signals and keep supply and demand in a constant balance.

![How stablecoins scale](/assets/images/cy19q1/stablecoins-scale.png){: .align-center}*How stablecoins scale*

Professional arbitrage requires a closed cycle. The faster and more efficient the cycle can be iterated through, the more closely will supply track demand in either direction. For an example, let us look at a collateralized fiatcoin, Tether (USDT).

When market demand pushes the price of USDT against USD to $1.02, the market signals to the arbitrageur to start working. He sends $1.00 USD to Tether Inc. and receives 1 USDT in return. Since the market currently values USDT at $1.02, it buys him $1.02 worth of USD, for an immediate profit of $0.02. The same is true in the other direction when the price of USDT falls to $0.98. Arbitrageurs will buy up USDT for $0.98 USD, send it to Tether Inc. and redeem it for $1.00 in USD, again closing the cycle with a profit.

### Professional arbitrage is impossible for Dai

There is no way to execute a closed cycle for Dai, so it's much harder to arbitrage.
We will demonstrate that by going through a hypothetical arbitrage cycle for Dai.

When market demand pushes the price of DAI to $1.02, you can again take $1.00 USD, buy $1.00 ETH (or any other asset that can be used as collateral) and lock it in a CDP. The problem, however, is that for each $1.00 ETH locked up, Maker will give you less than $1 of Dai. That is due to the requirement for over-collateralization. The current collateralization ratio is 150%, so $1.00 ETH in a CDP can generate up to 0.66 Dai (this ratio could change, but it's never going to be close to 100%).

Now you can certainly sell the 0.66 Dai at the same 2% premium, but you still have the original ETH locked up. The fundamental difference between "arbing" Tether and "arbing" Dai is that with Dai you also need to look for a profitable way to exit the collateralized debt position at a later date. And it's only going to be profitable if you manage to buy back the Dai for less than you sold it for.

While you wait for the price of Dai to drop, you are stuck in an unfortunate position:

1. You don't know when, or if, the price of Dai will fall again
2. Since you cannot complete all the steps of the cycle simultaneously, you are stuck with long exposure to ETH while you wait. You want to sterilize the risk by shorting ETH, but that incurs an additional borrow cost.
3. You have an additional cost of capital for locking up the part of sterilized ETH you didn't borrow Dai against, which is at least 33% (since you can draw $0.66 Dai for every $1 ETH). The cost of that is the risk-free rate of USD.
4. There is an additional cost for closing the CDP.

USDT and other collateralized fiatcoins allow for closed arbitrage cycles because the collateralization ratio is 100% and not higher. Arbitrageurs can create $1 of USDT with $1 of USD, then sell the USDT and be done with it — they no longer have to worry about the USD "locked up" in Tether Inc.'s bank account. Those USD are someone else's problem now. The existence of committed arbitrageurs allows USDT supply to closely track demand.

We established that Dai arbitrage is very costly, but is there a point where it becomes profitable? The collateralization ratio of ETH and Dai is fixed at 1.5:1, so 1 ETH currently creates 0.66 Dai. If the price of Dai were $1.50 or higher, $1 ETH would create $1 Dai. At this point, you can sell the Dai and forget about it your CDP — just as you would with USDT — except that you even have a free option at buying back your ETH later. So deterministically, pure arbitrage is profitable at $1.50. Probabilistically, it's going to be profitable below $1.50, but there is no guarantee to close the cycle within a predictable window of time.

Of course, this is purely hypothetical -people are not going to bid Dai up to $1.50, or even $1.10. It's much cheaper to simply use another stablecoin, or if none existed-say for reasons of regulation — sterilize a volatile asset like ether or bitcoin by shorting it. So the price of Dai, even in a high demand scenario has a relatively low ceiling that will ensure that the professional arb window never opens.

### No arbitrage = no scaling

Now one can argue that the same premium will lead to more natural demand for CDPs, resulting in *some* arbitrage, and that is certainly correct. Natural CDP creators will be incentivized to arb the price at the margin, especially those who already have CDPs open and can generate some more Dai at minimal effort. But at every price level, there is still a natural ceiling to the demand for CDPs which doesn't exist when closed arb cycles are possible.

Why is the natural arbitrage by CDP creators not enough to make Dai scale? Remember, the faster a stablecoin can iterate through this cycle, the more closely will its supply track its demand. **The important part for stability is getting the price of your coin up to $1. But the important part for scalability is getting the price back down to $1** . Whenever the price is over $1, the demand for buying Dai is very low, since a potential buyer has to expect the price to normalize eventually. So the faster arbitrageurs can push the price back down to $1, the sooner the demand can rise again, leading to further increases in demand (up to a natural ceiling).

A professional arbitrageur is seeking to extract riskfree profits on a limited balance sheet, denominated in USD. Dai does not offer him any opportunities. The difference becomes clear when a buy order for 25M coins at a small premium comes to the market. For Dai, none of these people would open CDPs to create more Dai. In contrast, the same buy order on other stablecoins like USDT would generate an immediate supply increase, and arbers would sell the new supply to the buy order.

Because Dai doesn't allow for professional arbitrage, this cycle will play out very slowly, if at all. While for USDC or USDT new supply generation is triggered whenever a buyer pays more than $1, the generation of more Dai relies on vague demand for more debt on the CDP side. What does this mean for Maker?

### But... Maker is not primarily about the stablecoin

Dai's disability to scale has no impact on Maker because that was never the goal, to begin with. Maker is a decentralized and very efficient version of centralized lending services like BlockFi, the primary use case of which is tax arbitrage:

A loan from BlockFi enables you to use your cryptoassets as collateral and receive USD to your bank account. Borrowing against your cryptoassets enables you to receive liquidity now but does not trigger a capital gains tax event and, depending on the use of funds, the interest may be deductible against capital gains and other investment income. (Source: [https://blockfi.com/faq](https://blockfi.com/faq))

The two other prominent use cases are long leverage and treasury/payroll management for ICOs. The basic idea is always to generate liquidity *ahead of a future liquidity event* — spending money that you expect to receive later. Either from selling ETH after a tax deadline or from selling it at a higher price at a later time.

We believe Maker is a great service with a distinguished set of features. On the plus side, it offers lower friction, lower fees and less counterparty risk than centralized competitors and on the downside, lower maximum leverage, a lack of standard margin calls, and a steeper auto-liquidation penalty. It is the demand for Maker's core product — lending — that will determine the supply of Dai in existence, not the other way around.

If the price of Dai goes over $1, that will generally incentivize people to take slightly more debt, especially those who already have CDPs open. But it will not incentivize anyone to make a CDP to arbitrage the difference, not unless he was already indifferent towards taking a debt. Since all money locked in CDPs have to come from a natural demand for debt, there is also a natural ceiling to the amount of debt that people are going to take, and hence for the amount of Dai that will exist.

In our opinion, there are three takeaways. First, because professional arbitrage is unprofitable for Dai, supply will not track demand as it does for other stablecoins. It follows that more demand for Dai will not lead to a meaningful increase in demand for ether as collateral, either. If anything, demand for ether as collateral might go down as Maker starts adding more assets and allows users to borrow against them instead of only against ether.

Second, Maker is often mentioned as a figurehead of Ethereum, usually as a driver for price bullishness. But we believe that Maker's merit is less in "locking supply" and increasing demand for ether, which we showed is incorrect, and more about actual usefulness. Maker is proving that the Ethereum smart contract functionality can be used to create a highly efficient, decentralized version of BlockFi.

Last, it is now clear that too much attention was focussed initially on analyzing if Maker is a house of cards and Dai would hold the peg. The reality is it has survived a 90%+ decline in collateral value. This comes from a misunderstanding of the basic value proposition of Maker and Dai. It is not to create a scalable, censorship-resistant stablecoin. It is to be able to generate censorship resistant stability for anyone holding a volatile censorship resistant asset.

# [Unpacking Bitcoin's Assurances](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/unpacking-bitcoins-assurances-a3c98824d3f0)
## Dis-aggregating the system's guarantees
## By [Nic Carter](https://medium.com/@nic__carter)
## Posted Jan 13

It has rightfully been pointed out that Bitcoin's decentralization is but a means to an end — censorship resistance. This is in response to the decentralization fetishism that has characterized Bitcoin competitors and the blockchain industry in general. This is an appropriate response: cosmetic network decentralization is probably not sufficient if you plan on breaking any serious rules, and irrelevant if the industry you are seeking to disrupt is dentistry.

Bitcoin's fault-tolerant architecture was designed to survive extreme duress, and its multi-variate decentralization was created (or more accurately: emerged) to promote this. However, censorship resistance — the ability to broadcast information without restriction — does not fully cover the guarantees that Bitcoin provides to users, although it is perhaps the most significant.

In this post I will try and define the various guarantees that Bitcoin users can expect by taking advantage of the system's features over the entire usage lifecycle — from acquisition to exit. Censorship resistance is central to these but not sufficiently comprehensive. I call these 'assurances,' although they aren't perfectly assured, since things go wrong in the real world. (I've been a fan of 'assurances' in this context since reading [this post.](https://blog.goodaudience.com/1-assurances-in-crypto-14c55a1fd616)) I also take a stab at assessing how well Bitcoin enshrines those assurances today. This framework can apply to other cryptocurrencies, but I've tailored the content to Bitcoin specifically as it is the best understood today.

![Bitcoin's assurances by usage phase](/assets/images/cy19q1/carter-assurances-by-usage.png){: .align-center}*Bitcoin's assurances by usage phase*


## Open access

This is the shorthand for "the right to freely acquire Bitcoin." No amount of decentralization in Bitcoin's architecture itself can guarantee this. As many Bitcoiners will point out, free access to the asset requires a vibrant and competitive industry of fiat onramps. The existence of quasi monopolists attempting to build regulatory moats in order to raise barriers to entry threatens this. If acquisition of the asset can only occur in a couple large venues, they are not only susceptible to state action, but also liable to collusively deplatform individuals at will. Imagine what happens to the Venezuelan equivalent of Coinbase during a currency crisis: the government trivially shuts it down to preserve its monetary monopoly.

Thus, while large, regulator-friendly, conventional exchanges are good onramps in the developed world, where cryptocurrencies are not (yet) a threat to local sovereign currencies, they aren't a good fit for states experiencing demonetization or high inflation, which is where access is most impactful. Centralized exchanges must be supplemented by peer to peer exchanges like [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/), [Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com/), [Paxful](https://paxful.com/) — and indeed, they are the venues where trading seems to occur (Venezuelan traders are doing $300m annualized on LocalBitcoins, Nigeria ~$170m, Russia close to a billion USD). Wallets which allow for trust-minimized trading like [Opendimes](https://opendime.com/) are vital here — receiving an Opendime where you can be sure your counterparty doesn't know the private key beats waiting an hour for six confirmations.

Lastly, paper voucher systems enabling users to acquire smaller quantities of Bitcoin at street kiosks or from corner shops are an important piece of the puzzle. Vouchers work by exchanging fiat for a receipt with a code on it; settlement can be done later. I have a vision of [sarafis](https://hackernoon.com/the-key-to-bitcoin-adoption-in-developing-countries-60edfbe60786) in the streets of Tehran and Kabul hawking Bitcoin vouchers — small-scale entrepreneurial activity is much more robust to government activity than larger exchanges in a demonetization event. [Fastbitcoins](https://fastbitcoins.com/) and [Azteco](https://azte.co/) are two startups advancing this use-case; I expect many others to join them.

Peer to peer exchanges like [Hodl Hodl](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Hodl_Hodl#How_does_Hodl_Hodl_work.3F) rely on a crucial and unheralded technology: Bitcoin's native multi-signature (multisig) capability. A simple, well-understood, trusted, and widely-used multisig implementation enables massive secondary benefits. In the case of Hodl Hodl, it allows buyers and sellers to transact with a high degree of confidence that they will not be cheated. In 2-of-3 multisig contract, the seller and buyer must both sign the release transaction; and if one disagrees, it is referred to the arbitrator for a decision. In practice, the vast majority of transactions settle without arbitration — the threat of mediation itself enforces good behavior.

Multisig is popular in Bitcoin today: about 1.65m BTC (about $6b) are held in known multisig wallets. This figure climbs to 3.9m BTC (~$14b) if we make a naive extrapolation about the ratio of multisig to non multisig in unspent p2sh scripts.
![P2SH Address by Type](/assets/images/cy19q1/carter-assurances-p2sh.png){: .align-center}*Source: [p2sh.info](https://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/p2sh-repartition-by-type?orgId=1)*


To sum up, open access to Bitcoin is a core component of the system — what use is the asset if you can't easily obtain it? — yet it is somewhat overlooked. It's important to be realistic about this. Bitcoin suffers from a paradox whereby individuals in countries with relatively less need for Bitcoin have frictionless access to it, while individuals dealing with hyperinflation have to reckon with a less developed onramp infrastructure. There is much work to be done here.

## Seizure resistance

One of the chief motivations for this article was to differentiate the unencumbered broadcast rights that Bitcoin grants users from the strong guarantees it grants to users when it is at rest. As mentioned above, censorship occurs at the time of broadcast, so 'censorship resistance' doesn't quite describe Bitcoin's unique properties when idle.

Thus the inclusion of **seizure resistance**(this is also sometimes referred to as 'tamper resistance' or 'judgment resistance'). By this I mean the ability of users to retain access to their Bitcoin under duress, during times of upheaval or displacement, all in a peaceful and covert way.

As Hasu and Su Zhu have [eloquently written](https://medium.com/@hasufly/bitcoin-and-the-promise-of-independent-property-rights-8f10e5c7efa8?sk=226124e0ff272801b8a9e49ce3403ac7), Bitcoin can be understood as an independent institution which provides users property rights which are untethered from the state or the legal system. As virtually all property rights trace back to the state, the legal system, or some local monopoly on violence, Bitcoin's cryptography-based property rights are a genuinely new paradigm.

This has been covered at length, but the fact that individuals can store their wealth in a 12 or 16-word passphrase held in their memory is quite astounding. While that's not the most failure-resistant way to operate, it makes one's wealth extremely portable and concealable.

Multisig also comes into play here. Innovative custody companies like [Casa](https://keys.casa/) (disclaimer: Castle Island is an investor) rely on a 3-of-5 multisignature setup whereby the user controls four keys physically dispersed, and Casa holds one for disaster recovery. This makes physical attacks on Bitcoin holders much more difficult and expensive, while preserving convenience and resilience to faults (seedless recovery is possible if a hardware wallet is lost). The secure key sharding that Bitcoin offers fundamentally reinvents what it means to be a custodian, and opens the door for all kinds of innovative hybrid models which offer various resilience/autonomy tradeoffs.

## Censorship resistance

This is the most celebrated assurance attributed to Bitcoin, so I'll be brief. At its core, Bitcoin allows permissionless broadcast through the p2p gossip protocol and the miner fee incentive. Anyone can make a transaction, although they have to sufficiently compensate a miner to include it in a block. If there is a lot of traffic, this could entail a delay or a higher fee. The other required component here is a well-connected network of nodes available to route transactions. If full nodes were to become very expensive and difficult to run, full node counts might decline, making broadcast more difficult. That said, node counts would have to drop precipitously to impair network performance, so this isn't an immediate concern.

One realistic impairment to censorship resistance is the simple approach of simply shutting off local access to the internet. While Bitcoin's global infrastructure cannot be realistically held back by even by the most motivated state actor, a state under severe monetary duress — experiencing a demonetization event, for instance — might take the extreme step of temporarily restricting access to Bitcoin by shutting off the internet. In recent memory, governments in [Iran](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-telegram-ban/), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_of_Wikipedia_in_Turkey), and [Russia](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246150/telegram-russia-ban) have shown themselves willing to exert massive collateral damage on local internet access to target services like Telegram and Wikipedia. Places like China where the internet and Bitcoin usage are already [tightly regulated](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-node-illegal-china/) would be well-positioned to impose such restrictions. It's not inconceivable that a state could attempt to target Bitcoin in such a manner.

Touted mitigations to state censorship of Bitcoin's broadcast layer include Nick Szabo's [long-range radio proposal](https://scalingbitcoin.org/stanford2017/Day2/Weak-Signal-Radio-Communications-for-Bitcoin-Network-Resilience.pdf) as well as [Samourai](https://github.com/MuleTools/PonyDirect)/[Gotenna's](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/samourai-and-gotenna-enable-bitcoin-transactions-without-internet-access/) SMS and short-range radio mesh proofs of concept. These initiatives, however, are still either in the R&D phase or the very earliest phases of deployment. At present, individuals in internet-restricted locations have little recourse when faced with such an attack, aside from physically getting their funds out of the country in a hardware or paper wallet. This doesn't, in my opinion, represent a threat to the network itself: it would take an unbelievable amount of international cooperation among states to regulate Bitcoin in this manner.

Network DOS attacks through fee spam are also an effective if costly way to make it more difficult for everyday users to broadcast transactions. There are few mitigations for this aside from waiting out the attacker or outbidding them.

## Counterfeit resistance

This is a crucial quality of the system, and yet it doesn't get quite the rhetorical exposure that censorship resistance does. **Counterfeit resistance** is simply the idea that individuals who use Bitcoin have very cheap access to the tools required to verify that payments they are receiving are legitimate, that their savings have not been debased through inflation, and that their counterparties aren't cheating them in some way.

Comparing Bitcoin to gold, the ability to run a full node is akin to owning a professional-grade XRF spectrometer to check the integrity of your bullion. Compared to the expensive and tricky tests to verify gold's authenticity, verifying the integrity of one's Bitcoin is a breeze. Running a node costs a few dollars a year and can be done on consumer hardware and bandwidth with little difficulty. This very accessible counterfeit resistance only persists as long as running a node is relatively cheap — a significant increase in the bandwidth, computation, or memory required to run a fully validating node would hinder it significantly. Right now, Bitcoin is growing at a stable rate, and physical plug-n-play node hardware has made full nodes more accessible than ever, so this assurance seems safe for now. For individuals and enterprises that don't want to run nodes directly, a good diversity of managed node software exists.

The other side of counterfeit resistance is the ability to determine that all units that exist were created according to a predefined, predictable schedule. The proof of work minting function, plus the difficulty adjustment, takes care of this. Well — close enough. Naively assuming that blocks were meant to arrive every 10 minutes on average, Bitcoin is actually slightly ahead of schedule by 30,000 blocks or so. This is because hash power has generally increased over time, and this caused block arrival to outpace the defined schedule due the coarse granularity in the difficulty adjustment. Aside from this interesting emergent property, Bitcoin's PoW has never been compromised, nor has the hash function been broken (and this doesn't seem eminently likely in the foreseeable future). Verifying that the correct number of units exist is as simple as running the _gettxoutsetinfo_ command in your Bitcoin Core node. The inherent auditability of Bitcoin and all of its derivatives is what makes deceptions like the [Bitcoin Private](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private/) covert inflation scandal easy to spot.

At present, Bitcoin's counterfeit resistance is made possible by a deliberate design philosophy from the core developers that prides accessibility and user self-sovereignty at all costs. It is augmented by a network of Bitcoin businesses that provide hardware nodes or managed access to node software. However, if the chain's growth were to radically accelerate, consumer-grade counterfeit resistance would be significantly impaired.

## Free exit

Free exit — the ability to sell Bitcoin unencumbered — is another aspect of the system that is sometimes overlooked. It's not strictly a Bitcoin guarantee, but Bitcoin's usefulness is significantly downgraded in its absence. The real world consequences of overzealous chain analysis companies (whose heuristics implicate innocent users through false positives) make themselves felt when those users attempt to sell their Bitcoin for fiat. Since fiat offramps are the most easily regulated and are run by risk-averse institutions, they are a natural target for entities that create blacklists and ascribe taint to individual UTXOs.

There are a few strategies to reckon with this. One is to obfuscate the origin of funds through collaborative tumblers like the [Wasabi wallet](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) . Another approach is to reverse-engineer the heuristics that chain analysis firms use and develop mixing strategies that implicate everyone in taint (thus rendering those heuristics incoherent) or that avoid detection altogether through specialized transaction types. This is the general approach of the folks behind the [Samourai](https://samouraiwallet.com/features) wallet. Routing around the centralized, highly-regulated exchanges is another option, either on the p2p marketplaces or by exchanging BTC for goods and services, rather than fiat.

Ultimately, I expect that a tranche of grey or black-market Bitcoins will emerge, with coins available at a discount in exchange for their reduced access to capital markets. This will not be a death knell — there will likely be more than enough demand globally for slightly cheaper Bitcoins, even if they cannot be traded on Coinbase. The world is a big place, with a variety of regulatory regimes, and individuals fleeing hyperinflation may not be too bothered by the fact that the Bitcoins they acquired cannot be deposited on US-regulated exchanges.

The objective for this piece was to present a framework of the major assurances that Bitcoin provides to users, and make it clear that censorship resistance is only one of them. Additionally, I wanted to make the point that Bitcoin the software is only one part of a much vaster system — a collaborative social and industrial project aiming to provide unencumbered financial tools to individuals the world over. Entrepreneurs that have created hardware wallets, merchant services, novel exchanges, voucher systems, Bitcoin contract structuring, and hybrid custody models have all done their bit to advance user sovereignty and discretion when it comes to their personal wealth. They deserve to be recognized, as does the broader struggle to make these touted assurances a reality.



# [96 Theses for Crypto in 2019](https://medium.com/@twobitidiot/96-theses-for-crypto-in-2019-1498fe1a14e)
## By [Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot)
##Posted January 14, 2019

_Often imitated. Never replicated. I call your predictions post, and raise you._

There have been a few good predictions pieces so far this year. This one is [my encore from last year](https://medium.com/tbis-weekly-bits/95-crypto-theses-for-2018-ca7b74f8abcf), with a little help from my colleagues at Messari, who are building the industry's best market intelligence platform.

Without further adieu...

### Top General Trends

1. Our top 2019 bets:
Lightning Network growth will blow up (50x YoY in USD growth = $100mm channel capacity) and have its "irrational exuberance" moment.
• Ethereum will face legitimate smart contract platform competition (EOS, Dfinity), AND "parachains" (Cosmos, Polkadot) will chip away at ETH's dominance.
• ICO's are dead (for now). It's all about security tokens...at least that's the narrative. New synthetic securities will be really exciting, the tokenized real estate assets we see in 2019 betas...marginally exciting, but not more than that.
• Privacy upgrades will cause headaches and pushback from regulated exchanges and wallets. Some of the new tech is so good it might hurt compliance efforts.
2. On Lightning Network, it's our theme of the year. We could see network growth get crazy and hit $100mm (50X 2018). It will continue to get easier to spin up nodes with out of the box solutions (e.g. [**Casa**](https://store.casa/lightning-node/)), and there will be numerous technical improvements (e.g. dual-funded channels), and perhaps major exchange buy-in. Arjun Balaji covered a bunch of these in [**his post**](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895), which I'll reference throughout this piece. (Want more plain English details on the state of Lightning?[**Andreas**](https://twitter.com/aantonop) also walks through some [**Lightning Network misconceptions**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4TjfaLgzj4) in this 20 minute video.)
3. Although we won't see a serious proposal this year to re-appropriate Satoshi's bitcoin or add perpetual low inflation to bitcoin in lieu of transaction fees, it does make sense to begin to explore. I wrote about this [**back in 2015**](https://medium.com/@twobitidiot/the-21mm-btc-soft-cap-71e14cd09946). *Eventually* this issue will come to a head: when bitcoin inflation dips below 1–2% (a few years), miner's incentives will skew to "attack" vs. "secure" the blockchain.
4. Serenity NOW! Ultimately, the transition from PoW to PoS is shaping up to be as messy and unpredictable as we should have expected. I'm excited about Ethereum 1.x (state pruning, Ewasm, transaction parallelization) because 2.0 won't ship before 2020 (earliest). I liked (Ethereum core developer) [**Lane Rettig's**](https://medium.com/@lrettig/how-open-is-too-open-bfc412cf0d24) breakdown, and CoinDesk also has a [**good backgrounder**](https://www.coindesk.com/developers-rally-around-ethereum-1x-a-new-roadmap-for-faster-scaling).
5. Top 20 coin hot takes:
BTC: Digital Gold | ETH: ICO Reserve | XRP: Too-Big-to-Jail-Coin | BCH (ABC): Bitmain Casino Chip | EOS: Wait, It's Legit? | XLM: Cool, Enigmatic | LTC: Now Useless | USDT: Surprise! They're Solvent. | TRON: omg, these guys own BitTorrent | BSV: Faketoshi Coin | ADA: DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? | IOTA: Ass hole founders | XMR: Fluffy Pony Reserve | BNB: exciting unregistered security | DASH: airplane promos | NEO: "Chinese ETH" | XEM: wtf is NEM? | ETC: [redacted]'s shitcoin | MKR: #DeFi Reserve | ZEC: Winning Privacy Coin
6. Top 10 people to keep an eye on in 2019:
CZ (Binance), Vitalik (Ethereum), Elizabeth Stark (Lightning Labs), Jae Kwon/Jutta Steiner (Cosmos/Polkadot), Zooko (ZCash), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Bram Cohen (Chia), Robert Leshner (Compound)/Nadav Hollander (Dharma), Will Warren (0x), Joe Lubin (ConsenSys), Arthur Hayes (BitMEX).
7. I know. Many of those are obvious, but they continue to be the ones to pay closest attention to. If I had to pick 5 more under-followed folks (sub-15k), I'd go with: Hasu (researcher), Mason Borda (TokenSoft), Yaniv Tal (TheGraph), Demi Brener / Manuel Araoz (Zeppelin) (both had great [**year-end pieces**](https://medium.com/@demibrener/state-of-crypto-2018-market-trends-7066f5484217), too), and Spencer Noon (investor).
8. Biggest rebounds? I'll be fascinated to see what happens with both Bitmain and ConsenSys, two of the world's largest crypto companies that got burned by concentrated crypto positions. I think Bitmain's IPO is in trouble, but rumors of ConsenSys's death have been greatly exaggerated.
9. Taxes will get more nightmarish. You thought thinking through ERC-20 like kind transactions and scraping Poloniex trade histories was bad? Try trading from a self-custodied wallet using a non-custodial exchange where your keys never move.
And what do you do about "interest" on staked tokens, or dapp usage where you leverage multiple tokens? It's near impossible to proactively report on these, so imagine the helluva time the IRS will have tracking all this down. Worse still, complexity means that audit victims are going to have a bad time explaining the esoterica to the men in suits.
10. Security tokens will fall flat. a) nobody actually cares about hard assets on the blockchain (beyond some initial hype and novelty), b) none of the assets / cashflows getting tokenized are interesting to crypto geeks. The "killer app" for STOs are DAOs, but don't expect those in 2019 because the infrastructure isn't there. Yet. (h/t [**Ben**](https://twitter.com/benhoneill)) AGREED

### DeFi / Open Finance

1. "Open finance" (lending, derivatives) will become the primary use case for Ethereum. Most other dApps (gaming, distributed storage, attention markets) will move to competing blockchains that are optimized for single uses. (h/t [**Eric**](https://twitter.com/ericturnr)) AGREED
2. The Gemini Dollar, Paxos, TrueUSD, or USDC will overtake Tether as the largest fiat-backed stablecoin. Three of the top ten assets by market cap will be fiat-denominated stablecoins by year-end. You can track the action [**here**](https://stablecoinindex.com/). (h/t [**Eric**](https://messari.io/blog/96-theses)) BOLD
3. A legitimate game development team will build an NFT app that gets more DAUs than any other dapp. Everyone is talking about Ethereum NFTs, but the Ethereum blockchain's performance is lagging its less decentralized competitors. Meanwhile, something viral will get built on EOS. (h/t [**Ben**](https://twitter.com/benhoneill))
4. It's getting less sexy, but I still believe in digital resource tokens for storage, computing, etc. Its importance isn't obvious to many (yet) and it's a five year vs. 2019 trend, but these tokens will be critical to fueling Web 3.0's growth. I've gotten more bullish on them recently as a) speech censorship globally is ramping up, b) the "Airbnb" model for of excess file storage / compute / cellular data seems intuitive, c) AWS margins are insane, and ripe for the "your margin is my opportunity" treatment...this time by disruptive distributed protocols. Filecoin is the one to keep the closest eye on. They'll launch by Q3. (Ok, maybe Q4).
5. I still believe in governance tokens with **serious** Most of these tokens were wildly overvalued last year, but many have crashed so viciously, they make more sense today. The litmus test? Is the governance token in question securing a valuable code base upon which a good deal of economic activity relies?
If so, you can value them sort of like insurance premiums. Ones you pay to guarantee the underlying code's reliability. I buy that narrative for Zeppelin (reusable smart contracts), 0x (reliable DEX logic), and Aragon (DAO governance). In those protocols, if the majority of "governors" abuse their power in any of these systems, the disenfranchised still retain the right to fork / exit.
6. Speaking of 0x, if you're them, you have to be thinking of how to share your token reserves with top relayers more efficiently. The previous top relayer by volume, DDEX,[**forked away**](https://blog.0xproject.com/ecosystem-update-ddex-and-the-0x-roadmap-5d201cafa133) in order to build on a $3 million market cap protocol token (Hydro) in which it had a stake. I wonder if these defections could be avoided with more generous token treasury distributions. Slippery slope, maybe.
7. 0x is making baby steps in that direction by rolling out incentive plans for market makers ([**announced yesterday, actually**](https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-the-0x-market-maker-program-42edc902b1f0)). This seems like a critical initiative as the DEX ecosystem has no small task in bootstrapping liquidity to become competitive with larger, faster, better custodial exchanges. Which leads to...
8. If any DEX captures significant market share, it'll be one built by a company with a centralized exchange (e.g. Bitfinex, Binance). The giants already own the user relationship, have the liquidity and market making capabilities to make spreads competitive, and UI to abstract away the actual DEX. (h/t [**Qiao**](https://twitter.com/QWQiao))
9. After [**regulatory action against EtherDelta**](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-258) chilled DEX developers' willingness to push the envelope, and neutered perceived advantages of decentralized trading, we'll see a DEX launch with completely anonymous founders (a la Grin), with code similar to Bittorrent's. (h/t [**Eric**](https://twitter.com/ericturnr))
10. That anonymity might be a critical missing piece of the DeFi movement in general. Here's my five variable formula to create unstoppable commerce:
_secure wallet hardware + DEX + stablecoins + zk-SNARKs + high-throughput smart contract platform = Web 3.0._If you can store value, exchange freely, self-custody, and program scalable contracts, you can conduct any type of transaction.
11. Over time, DEX will be an indispensable abstraction for machine to machine smart payments, and application interoperability. Today, however, the killer app for DEX may be tax evasion (see #9). DEX power traders will be tough to trace, and you'd be willing to pay a 2% spread if it meant 20% in capital gains evasion. (NOT A RECOMMENDATION. I use TokenTax.co)
12. DEX skeptics underestimate the hassle of global asset onboarding to centralized exchanges. DEX protocols can support new tokens instantly, so in a future with thousands (or millions) of tokens, "listings fees" will be obsolete, and liquidity pools will aggregate globally.
13. Are DeFi spreads silly? Of course! That's how this starts, not how it ends. We work our way from the most chronically underserved retail user to enterprise adopters, not the other way around. BitMEX is a $10 billion company because it helped bootstrap a global margin trading market for [**"degenerate gamblers**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/07/bitmex-lets-you-bet-big-on-bitcoin-for-a-price/)."
14. I'm extremely excited about [**Ripio's collaboration with MakerDAO**](https://medium.com/makerdao/makerdao-partners-with-ripio-to-bring-dai-to-south-america-via-fiat-on-off-ramp-e22ac71a210d?source=rss------blockchain-5%C2%A0). Bringing dollar-pegged lending products to customers in an economy experiencing 40% annual inflation is massive. I'm sure the compliance teams are buttoned up, but even if these initiatives aren't explicitly blessed by regulators, they're worth pursuing aggressively. I view stablecoin fueled cross-border credit as a killer app for crypto.
15. Speaking of MakerDAO (track it [**here**](https://mkr.tools/) — graphic below), it's today's most systemically important crypto dapp. $Dai should power all sorts of DeFi applications, while centralized stablecoins end up getting relegated to a primary use case of facilitating inter-exchange liquidity. Fully reserved regulated stablecoins are less "crypto," more just simply "finance."
16. Dai also survived one of its most significant tests in 2018. "Can Dai survive a market crash?" Asked and answered. Dai survived the 94% drawdown in ETH, and the move from a single-collateral to multi-collateral model should accelerate its adoption in 2019. (Now if we can [**just scale it safely**](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484)...no one yet knows whether Dai works without significant over-collateralization. Big TBD.)
17. Dollar-backed stablecoins will catapult "open finance" into mainstream adoption. The idea of dollar backed stablecoins will be generalized to other asset classes, i.e. a token that tracks S&P 500. New crypto indices that mirror traditional asset performance (synthetic crypto securities) are a massive untapped (and probably illegal) market that could pick up steam in 2019. (h/t [**Qiao**](https://twitter.com/QWQiao))

### Other Killer Dapps

1. The top dapp markets at the end of this year will prove to be the ones already running experiments, although the market leaders may (will?) change. I'm more bullish than ever on prediction markets (Augur), lending products (Compound), and digital gaming assets (Decentraland).
2. Re current Dapp usage being slow / non-existent: a) it's expected (we're in the "toy" stage), b) we should compare Dapp stats to 2019's most hyped project, Lightning (e.g. $2M $REP staked = current $2M LN capacity), c) Dapps with a stablecoin are far more usable than Dapps with ETH. Usage will come slowly, but surely. Until then, usage charts will look ugly.
3. Speaking of Augur's $REP, prediction markets may eke out steady growth this year, but it won't be explosive because market making is still so risky (potentially illegal gambling or unregistered futures trading) for such a small payout. The CFTC's "[**developer liability**](https://messari.substack.com/p/code-will-be-law-unqualified-opinions)" assertion was chilling, there is no major catalyst for volumes until the 2020 election, and the top prediction market may be highly centralized. Good teams will figure out how to better abstract away the tech. One of my top companies to watch in 2019 will be [**Veil**](https://veil.co/) ([**funding announcement**](https://medium.com/veil-blog/introducing-veil-649036f9d492)).

### Macro/Politics/Taxes

1. I like Fred Wilson's [**President Pence by EoY prediction**](https://avc.com/2019/01/what-is-going-to-happen-in-2019/). Part of me hopes it's so. Especially after last night. But Trump is more likely to get reelected than he is to resign. How do most people still underestimate how little he gives AF? The Democrats will blink over "the wall" before the gov't reopens. (And I doubt they blink anytime soon. Did you watch the addresses last week???)
2. Why bring this up in a crypto post? Well, Trump wreaking havoc on the government (shutdowns, scandals, god help us if a national security crisis emerges), impacts the crypto markets insofar that crypto is still a highly correlated "risk" asset that will crater further in a macro recession. Generally, political dysfunction slowly advances the move from USD as reserve currency to something new, and that could greatly benefit bitcoin. So long as the dysfunction isn't severe.
3. The shutdown will impact bodies that still need to provide better clarity on crypto tax rules (IRS) and the bitcoin ETF (SEC — next deadline is in Feb). It will also delay the 60+ crypto companies (word of mouth) that have filed for a Reg A+ offering, which allows companies to offer shares to the general public. Without approval, a lot of those tokens cannot be legally distributed. ([**KWu**](https://twitter.com/katherineykwu))
4. The two greatest American lies: "Rising debt isn't a big deal because the dollar is a reserve" (we'll lose reserve status by 2030); "If you don't like things, vote!" (voting for big gov't right (R) and big gov't left (D) isn't a choice if you're in the small gov't party. "Exit" is a choice. Long live bitcoin!)
5. Speaking of losing reserve currency status... Given Brexit, the Chinese economic slowdown, the rise of global populism, etc. 2019 will be the year a top 50 central bank starts purchasing crypto as a speculative bet on a new type of disaster hedge. Look to mid-inflation developing economy banks in particular. What is there to lose? It's an asymmetric bet.
6. Things aren't all doom and gloom. It doesn't take magic mushrooms to appreciate we live in an era of abundance. The average time an average human needs to work to purchase a given commodity [**has fallen 65%**](https://humanprogress.org/article.php?p=1603). As that falls, we get further from a Mad Max-level dystopia. My favorite 2019 prediction: things will continue to get better! So stay rationally optimistic.

### Information overload:

1. The bad news is that along with our commodity abundance, we also have information abundance, yet finite attention. We tend to get more of our information based on its memetic value these days (see #41), and what is "popular" vs. what is mentally nutritious, which is one reason the web is such a wasteland of messy, unstructured, and unreliable information. Curation markets will be massive for solving some of our attention and information problems even if early concepts have struggled.
2. Yes, token curated registries launched to date have been disastrous, ineffective, and offered questionable incentives. ConsenSys has a few interesting experiments to keep an eye on though ([**TruSet**](https://www.truset.com/),[**Party**](https://www.tcr.party/)), and I'm watching developments from Slava ([**Relevant**](https://relevant.community/)) and Thibauld ([**Continuous Organizations**](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-continuous-organizations-22ad9d1f63b7?gi=f4d0f574fe7a)) closely as we think about how to roll out Messari's token registry.
This primitive is young. There are solutions to all the critiques...
+ popularity contest! -> well, design TCRs for popularity contests, then! + easy to corrupt at launch! -> well, distribute the registry tokens slowly to strategic parties and incorporate lock-ups / illiquidity by design!
+ who's actually going to vote on this?! -> make sure you include delegated voting logic so token-holders can vote by proxy!
3. Lots of good niche data services. No great information aggregators and curators. Messari is going to win this market. (Or I'm going to be eating ramen until the Citadels pop up.) Stay tuned.
4. People will finally realize valuation metrics like NVT have no predictive power because you can game them. We'll also get much [**better measures of token size and importance**](https://blog.nomics.com/essays/crypto-market-cap-review-emerging-alternatives/) than market cap, likely a liquidity adjusted market cap.
5. Technical analysis on BTC and other liquid cryptoassets will become much less effective as real prop shops begin operating with meaningful capital. Crypto economic data will become more valuable as people bargain shop, and that will coincide with a decline in CoinMarketCap's dominance.

### Memes and Meanies:

1. Success in crypto community building hinges on memes:
Pomp: "The Virus is Spreading." "Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers."
Blockstream: "Make bitcoin great again." "Don't trust, verify."
Neeraj: Take the least sexy crypto role (policy), and win w/ 24/7 memes.
2. When you're behind in the polls, go negative. Or troll your way to the top. Vitalik coined the term bitcoin maximalism in 2014 to combat critics.
Gemini's "Crypto Needs Rules" campaign is BRILLIANT.
Mike Dudas / TheBlock started with obnoxious as a strategy. It's working.
3. One of my favorite lines from 2018 came from Ameen Soleimani, who told me BTC vs. ETH communities were like Spartans vs. Athenians [**in this scene**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI6sARmxEuc) from 300. 2019 will show which ETH Athenians earn their warrior stripes and which jump ship to other protocols. Many Ethereum folks have never been through a crypto bear market. Many will run out of money. How religious will they be once the dry powder runs out?
4. #XRPthestandard is a top all time astroturfing campaign from the Ripplecoin aficionados. These folks have reinvented truth, attacked and pissed off everyone else in crypto, and still get to delude themselves into [**thinking a former President is a fan**](https://ripple.com/insights/president-bill-clinton-keynotes-swell-2018/) of the project. "I'm not even mad. That's amazing."
5. You look like this when you get all tribal about your favorite crypto. But you'll never admit it. (h/t [**Roger Ver**](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1081541185921941509))


![Favorite Cartoon](/assets/images/cy19q1/selkis-cartoon){: .align-center}*All time favorite cartoon. Gets better with age.*


### #Influencers

1. [**The 1 million bitcoin lawsuit against Craig Wright**](https://messari.io/article/u-s-court-denies-craig-wright-motion-to-dismiss-1-1-million-btc-lawsuit) will prove once and for all that he is, in fact, not Satoshi, but he will continue pandering to the less sophisticated masses about his early involvement to shill shitforks and obvious scams until he has no more ammunition (social, crypto, or otherwise) left. (h/t [**Ben**](https://twitter.com/benhoneill))
2. (47a, for those wondering the count.) Actually, Ben's wrong. I continue to believe Craig was at least part of whoever created Satoshi Nakamoto, and he's been hiding in plain sight. [**This lawsuit**](https://messari.io/article/u-s-court-denies-craig-wright-motion-to-dismiss-1-1-million-btc-lawsuit) IS the most interesting thing to watch this year in the search for Satoshi.
3. CoinDesk, Breaker, TheBlock are all tracking the movements of execs in the industry well and killing it on the research and content. But if CoinDesk doesn't fix its site performance and cut down on the dogshit adware, TheBlock will eclipse them by year-end. CoinDesk has great content, but is totally unreadable. It's Forbes-level terribleness on Chrome.
4. I'm intrigued by efforts I've seen to score crypto twitter using a "people rank" algo that monitors strength of following. Heavy bias for tenure in crypto, but the work [**Iconomist**](https://iconomist.com/) &[**one**](https://hive.one/) have done is interesting. These will end up being incredible tools to leverage in curation markets.
(Bonus points, I'm in a fun sandwich between two former masters:)

![Selkis is a fraud](/assets/images/cy19q1/selkis-fraud){: .align-center}*I'm so popular. When will you realize I'm a fraud?*


### Markets & Price

1. A portfolio consisting of 50% Tron + 50% XRP will outperform a portfolio consisting of 50% LTC + 50% ETC. (Centralized marketing and execution definitely helps.) The S&P 500 will outperform HOLD10 on a risk-adjusted basis. (h/t [**Qiao**](https://twitter.com/QWQiao)) BOLD
2. Look to developing markets for salvation: If there's a bull market in 2019, it'll be driven by Europe, South America, or Africa. If anyone builds an open finance killer app on Ethereum, it will be a team based in a developing country. (h/t [**Qiao**](https://twitter.com/QWQiao))
3. Bitcoin isn't dead. Ethereum isn't dead. But the "great cleansing" of top 100 cryptos on CMC won't happen overnight. It takes time to flush out crap. We only get "decoupling" of quality and crap during bear markets, *not* vertical bull runs. Look at the [**Dec 2013 top 20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20140112/) assets, they're almost all long gone.
4. Returns in crypto will be captured by money/store of value like assets vs startup equity. BTC will outperform equity in Coinbase, Binance, BitMEX, and all of today's other crypto unicorns over the next five years. If this doesn't prove true, it's because BTC somehow lost its lead.
5. BTC and ETH have bottomed. (Maybe wishful thinking, but the November crash sure felt like January 2015.)
6. Filecoin, Telegram, and Cosmos will launch within the next 12 months and catapult to the top 10 crypto assets by market cap. (That's a lot of top 10 turnover in a less liquid market if I'm right.)

### Privacy

1. Lightning will start to be used as a privacy layer for BTC transactions. There will be a lot more talk of privacy solutions for later-1 on bitcoin, but no progress that impacts end users. (h/t [**Dan**](https://twitter.com/robustus))
2. Arjun [**outlined**](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895) the monster year in Bitcoin privacy research. But I'm skeptical hosted wallets and exchanges will make speedy upgrades when these features are rolled out due to regulatory concerns. The race is on between Chainalysis + Elliptic (the two largest on-chain data forensics companies) and crypto privacy engineers to unshield, obfuscate, unshield transactions (ad infinitum). Monero, ZCash, Bitcoin, Grin, BEAM...there's so much to look forward to if you're a hardcore privacy advocate...or a technical sleuth. Cops and robbers for Web 3.0.
3. Privacy tech's success also means we'll eventually we'll have to move to an opt-in disclosures system, where most economic actors provide their business partners or regulators/authorities with view keys to key accounts and transactions. The powers that be won't let a multi-trillion dollar shadow financial system emerge with no surveillance capacity. Entrepreneurs know this, so will ultimately be more proactive about this.
4. No one really understands privacy solutions. Few actually use the tools that *do* exist. If privacy upgrades aren't abstracted away by developers, or there aren't real economic incentives to adopt them, no one will push for them. This is a pithy take, but it's worth reiterating over and over and over again because zk-SNARKS, zk-STARKs, Confidential Transactions, etc. aren't worth anything if they aren't actually embedded in useable products.
5. Great take from researcher [**Hasu**](https://twitter.com/hasufl) (h/t Token Daily): _"Bitcoin will continue to get more private: LN and sidechains offer full fungibility if you accept certain tradeoffs of trust and security. Dandelion will add more privacy on the p2p network layer (harder to do UTXO forensics). My fingers are crossed for Schnorr signatures in 2019 (these hide multi-signature transactions_ _—_ _that would be a huge deal in combination with Coinjoin). Private transactions by default would be encouraged, because it_ _'_ _s cheaper to share a signature (the biggest/costliest part of a bitcoin transaction) with others."_

### Top-Down Regulation — Boo.

1. The SEC's mandates are to facilitate responsible capital formation, promote fair and efficient markets, and protect investors. But their slowness, vagueness, and demonstrated enforcement-first mindset will lead to more market opacity, and offshoring. U.S. teams are getting frustrated that all conversations with regulators are one-way streets.
2. A large, offshore exchange will face serious legal action from a U.S. regulator (even if the exchange blocks IPs or restricts U.S. user access via its terms of service). It will set up an epic legal showdown, as $10 billion companies usually don't roll over without a fight. (h/t [**Eric**](https://twitter.com/ericturnr))
3. Ripple will get away with murder. Too well capitalized (~$500M in 2018 $XRP sales), too well connected (ex-regulators Mary Jo White, Ben Lawsky, Gene Sperling are advisors or directors) to face trouble for their private money sales to retail. Negligible, if any, fine, showcasing the ineffectiveness of relying on the state.
4. Thanks to SEC/CFTC hostility and uncertainty, we'll see more anonymously deployed token projects and sales. Some will be legit like [**MimbleWimble**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/01/08/mimblewimble-history-technology-and-the-mining-industry/). Others will be epic scams made possible only because SEC regs drove people to this behavior. (#self-regulation) (h/t [**Dan**](https://twitter.com/robustus))
5. Token ratings and research shops in the U.S. are going to flirt with the SEC as well. Rating tokens "BB" based on your interpretation of the NVT ratio, a TradingView chart, and a witty telegram post is going to lead to some questions about how and who you're marketing those scores to, anyway.
6. The SEC will do nothing of real import aside from impede the progress of good teams, pick easy cases, make scammers harder to identify, and block the actually useful bitcoin ETF. Elon spoke for [**crypto twitter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRNypdYQoWk) when he said: "I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC."
7. This was a [**good take from Arjun**](https://medium.com/@arjunblj/crypto-theses-for-2019-dd20cb7f9895) that I pretty much agreed with wholeheartedly: _"Some of the US-based teams working on the DeFi stack are taking on material risk and will face regulatory scrutiny in the US (70% confidence) given their move into structured products. This will test the runaway killer app of Ethereum: regulatory arbitrage (first with the offering of unregistered securities offerings and now with quasi-legal structured derivatives), as teams "move fast and break_ [_**the law**_](https://messari.io/blog/96-theses) _." While engineers are discussing "compounding financial primitives," I'm worried about compounding technical (or legal) risk."_

### Market / Self-Regulation — Yay!

1. There will be a ton of asset delistings this year. For many exchanges, trading certain cryptos is too much of a headache for little to no return. I'm talking about the absolute *gems* like Clams, PascalCoin, Viacoin, and Primecoin. (All still on Polo. All sub 50k in daily trading volume and single digit millions float. There will be blood...)
2. There will be voluntary and involuntary conversions of ICOs to security tokens. [**ICONOMI**](https://medium.com/iconominet/a-new-chapter-for-iconomi-transformation-of-corporate-governance-and-issuance-of-equity-tokens-dc603df2272b) did it the "voluntary"(?) way. Others will do it the involuntary way either via [**SEC enforcement**](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-264%C2%A0) (Airfox, Paragon) as teams are forced to brush up on investor rescission rights. We also have a new brand of [**activist investor**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181219005016/en/Peter-Thiel-Digital-Currency-Group-Invest-Crypto) who's entering the fray, something I'm especially excited to watch unfold with respect to converting tokens to equity, or other protocol tokens.
3. Messari will onboard 100+ projects to our crypto registry. (We're closing in on 20. If you're interested in staking / sponsoring your favorite token team,[**hit us up**](https://messari.io/registry)!) Binance, Coinbase Pro, Polo, and others will require basic disclosures + add them to their sites.
4. I'm really hoping GDF, the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, the VCA, ADAM and others [**play nicely together**](https://messari.substack.com/p/sympathy-for-the-sec-unqualified). Crypto self-regulatory groups seem like they're going to almost inevitably compete and talk past each other. I hope I'm wrong, but standards setting in 2019 will look like this:

Opinionated people tilting against windmills wrt standards setting.

### Life hacks

1. For those who swear to make new years resolutions, but have a tough time keeping them, this is an awesome [**habits tracker**](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1079768556882092032.html), you can use. I recommend also reading the [**original thread**](https://twitter.com/ali01/status/1078647576201703427) on forming new habits from Ali at a16z.
2. This [**multiple inbox custom gmail implementation**](http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more) changed everything for me a few years ago. I actually keep up with email now, and regularly hit inbox 0. (_Update: Jinx. I'm now at 50 again._) It's tough to get shit done with a messy desk or desktop or inbox. I promise you, it's worth the 30 minutes to set this up. It will pay dividends for years.
3. Don't worry if you're not waking up at 4am, meditating, working out for three hours, eating keto, and journaling. Self-improvement is great, but this is how Ali's boss claims to start his day:

![Image Description](/assets/images/cy19q1/selkis-pmarca.png){: .align-center}*pmarca knows what's up*


### Protocol Wars

1. For the die hards trying to keep up with the various ETH scaling proposals, Arjun did a nice job aggregating them all. If this looks complex, it's because it is. Now try to imagine Ethereum 2.0 actually coming to market successfully in the next 18 months herding all of these cats:![Eth Scaling](/assets/images/cy19q1/selkis-eth-scaling.png){: .align-center}*yikes*
2. EOS will surpass ETH. EOS could surpass ETH in dapp activity; as serenity delays continue, developer mindshare will wander; EOS smart contracts use C++ and compile into WebAssembly (better dev experience); on-chain governance works in EOS, isn't close in ETH. (h/t [**Jane**](http://@janeylwang))
3. Various ETH competitors with seasoned executives, top VC backers, and technically superior platforms will run aggressive marketing campaigns, but stall as ETH's culture, grassroots mindshare, and developer network-effect lead prove too strong to overcome. (h/t [**Dan**](https://twitter.com/robustus))
4. This month could be a messy one in Ethereum. We'll see major pushback from disenfranchised ETH miners around the Constantinople upgrade (which, among other changes is going to crush ETH miner margins further by reducing block rewards 33%). [We'll find out tomorrow.]
5. Protocol M&A! In this bear market, consolidation is inevitable at the company level. But it will make more sense for many teams to merge together than fork away from each other. The TRON and Stellar acquisitions of BitTorrent and Chain were the biggest M&A eye-openers in 2018 (even moreso than Polo to Circle and Earn to Coinbase). This year, the question isn't about companies that will get acquired, but how many low market cap crypto tokens will "merge" with larger competitors?
6. We'll see more tokens [**buy back portions of their supply**](https://sludgefeed.com/icon-surges-after-announcing-token-buyback-program/) like ICON did. Here's a few token projects trading well below their estimated [**balance sheet ETH coffers**](https://projecttransparency.org/):
Aragon: Market Cap $14MM | Balance Sheet $26MM
DigixDAO: Market Cap $42MM Balance $58MM
Gnosis: Market Cap $13MM,117 Balance $28MM
7. Could we see more tokens proactively burn some of their undistributed treasury tokens to ensure the majority of their supplies are decentralized [**like Numerai did**](https://www.coindesk.com/numerai-to-cut-token-supply-by-10-million-to-become-decentralized-as-fck)? If a token project: a) issued 100% of its supply at inception, b) currently holds more tokens in treasury than is circulating, c) doesn't have a pre-defined secondary sales process, then the entity should burn a significant portion of its treasury tokens! That would look like a share repurchase in equities, but with no capital outlay required or board approval. Just a snap of the fingers.
8. While it would be great to continue to see new crypto VC blood enter the fray to take advantage of bear market prices, the universe of crypto fund managers is unlikely to see many new entrants until the next hype cycle. The ones that closed their funds know they are now in position to "[**Raise during bubbles, deploy during busts.**](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1082148158602240000)"
9. We'll continue to see an explosion of [**ecosystem development funds**](https://multicoin.capital/2018/10/23/the-evolving-role-of-crypto-investors/), but for smaller projects. Metaverse was an [**interesting early example**](https://insights.dcg.co/introducing-metaverse-ventures-f82fc09a5f83). Multicoin capital frames it well: _"Just as a traditional VC firm would set aside capital for follow on rounds, we believe that crypto investors who typically invest in protocols will find it's a best practice to also set aside capital for supporting the network."_
10. Bitcoin benefits from its static nature. There's just one problem: bitcoin will have more contentious hard forks in the future. A big one will be around changing the hard cap as the fee market compresses, another will be — you guessed it — around the block size. We know forks are risky and dilutive, but the next one will be a real threat, because it will likely incorporate significant privacy upgrades that governments will not like and block at all costs.

### Then They Join You

1. I'm bearish on Facebook's stablecoin in the short-term. The WhatsApp Indian remittance target use case is not compelling, and crypto regulation in India is notoriously tough to navigate. USD works fine as a parallel currency most places, and competitive services are entrenched. The Indian government won't look kindly upon a private company undermining its monetary sovereignty. (h/t [**KWu**](https://twitter.com/katherineykwu))
2. Very few blockchains that raised mega pre-launch rounds will find product-market fit. One that will actually launch, and have wild success, will be Telegram. Top team, massive user base, crypto ethos, and they'll fork whichever relevant crypto protocols work for their own purposes. Good artists copy. Great artists steal. (h/t [**Eric**](https://twitter.com/ericturnr))
3. As global macro fears return, talk of central bank digital currencies — and their Orwellian surveillance and control — will excite Big Brothers globally. BTC will remain an antidote to financial totalitarianism. CBDCs "replacing bitcoin" will become this cycle's "blockchain not bitcoin" stupid establishment meme. (h/t [**Dan**](https://twitter.com/robustus))
4. China will be the first to issue a sovereign-backed digital currency that *actually* sees widespread adoption. China's economy is already highly digitized, and this could be a way for the Yuan to replace (or seriously threaten) USD as the dominant reserve currency. (h/t [**KWu**](https://twitter.com/katherineykwu))

### Great Artists Steal

Throwback to a few October 2017 forward-looking predictions from Daniel Jeffries that I really liked, and am going to steal for 2019. Full post is [here](https://hackernoon.com/what-will-bitcoin-look-like-in-twenty-years-7e75481a798c) .

1. _"Many governments will not sit by and lose control of the money supply without a vicious fight. Anyone working on a project right now should be anticipating protocol level assaults on decentralized cryptos and designing defenses against them."_ China is still a major threat to bitcoin. The U.S. less so, because the government is so slow and dysfunctional.
2. _"The same factors that make it hard to form consensus across a blockchain, make it hard for all the world's governments to agree on anything. They won't be able to do it. Some governments will love decentralization and others will hate it."_ Smaller governments (e.g. Malta, Singapore, Estonia) can make asymmetric bets on crypto and potentially catapult their economies forward. This trend will continue to accelerate as PBOC crackdowns continue and as the SEC pursues more frequent enforcement actions.
3. " _We will have four dominant meta coins, plus fifty to one hundred minor coins, and infinite virtual variations of these coins, plus state coins. At this point I can only see four types of coins needed, with a blockchain of blockchains (or post-blockchain tech) seamlessly swapping them as needed to consume services: Deflationary Saver Coin_ _—_ _hoarding and investing, these rise over time like a_ _"_ _digital gold_ _"_ _—_ _it_ _'_ _s the reason Bitcoin started in the first place; Inflationary Spender Coin_ _—_ _inflationary coin mirrors the dollar today, these are the stablecoin experiments; Action Token_ _—_ _actions on the network that should always be free (i.e. voting); Reward Token_ _—_ _designed to flow around the system as a digital representation of karma, incentivizing good behavior and punishing bad behavior; You could literally build the ultimate universal system with just these four coins. Every other coin could simply act as a subcomponent with different metadata."_

And my favorite three from the ~40 I read on Token Daily's curated 2019 prediction piece. (Curate the curators!)

1. Alex Pack (co-founder, Dragonfly Capital) _"The largest crypto businesses in the world are already in Asia_ _—_ _of the top 20 exchanges by volume no more than a handful are based outside of Asia, as are the largest mining companies. In 2019, we will start to see these exchanges and mining companies act as distribution channels, offering new financial products and smart contract-based applications to their users."_
2. Benny Giang (co-founder of Cryptokitties) _"Korean market will have consolidation amongst technology and crypto businesses next year. There will be a huge effort amongst some of the top gaming companies to break into this space. What this means as a whole, is that Korea will be leading the way for consumer adoption early next year. We'll see lots of questions about decentralized systems being slow vs semi-centralized systems with mass adoption. (The Multicoin Capital debate on platform-grade vs. sovereign-grade censorship resistance)"_
3. Benny again _"Japan's largest tech companies have secretive R&D teams. From my perspective, I don't think a lot of the efforts will translate into new business lines in 2019. However, there is a handful of experienced veteran game producers who have formed their own blockchain gaming studios. A lot of high-quality blockchain games will be released in Japan late Spring to Summer of next year. This will set a new standard for hybrid on/off chain blockchain games."_

### Us and Me

1. I've always been the best at shameless self-promotion. My thought leadership, influencer status, pioneer pedigree, plus general authenticity and good humor is why Unqualified Opinions will be a top 50 crypto newsletter and podcast by 2020. Share with your friends, and show some bear market love. [**Give a gift subscription**](https://messari.substack.com/subscribe?&gift=true) **.** Or contact us about corporate subscription rates. No one ever got fired for paying an idiot with the corporate Amex. (At least no one I'd tell you about.)
2. But actually, I'm terrified UO is going to suck, and it's going to be all my fault and CT and the subscribers alike will finally tell me what a fraud I am. If our new podcast underperforms, remember this interview [**instead**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik83dXsbAls), which captures my thoughts on the year ahead. It's me being my best self.

Hope y'all are your best selves in 2019 as well.

Keep building. Beat the bear.

# [Tweetstorm: Bitcoin as SoV](https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1084848063947071488?lang=en)
## By [Dan Held](https://twitter.com/danheld)
## Posted January 14, 2019

**1)** Satoshi's Vision™ is a silly endeavor, as it doesn't matter what it was, we are where we are now. However, those pushing the "Bitcoin was first made for payments" narrative insist on cherry-picking sentences from the white paper and forum posts to champion their perspective.
**2)** The following tweetstorm is a categorical repudiation of this tired narrative. Bitcoin was purpose-built to first be a Store of Value (SoV), a thread:
**3)** How do we determine Satoshi's intention? We need to look at his ideology, description of functionality/architecture, timing, and audience. Let's start with how Satoshi describes the problem Bitcoin solves. In his first public comms after the whitepaper, in the first paragraph:
**4)** "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust." - Satoshi
**5)** He later expands on that Libertarian thought in his other writings:
"[with Bitcoin] we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years." — Satoshi Nakamoto
**6)** How does Satoshi describe Bitcoin? His forum posts provide insight through his consistent gold/metal analogy:
"Bitcoin [is] more like a collectible or commodity." - Satoshi
**7)** "In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases" - Satoshi
**8)** "As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: [not useful/no utility]. And one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel" - Satoshi
**9)** "If there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)" - Satoshi
**10)** "It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy." - Satoshi
Satoshi here clearly highlights that Bitcoin's scarcity gives it value... as a SoV. Limited supply is meaningless for VISA 
**11)** So we now have an idea of Satoshi's motivations, and how he describes Bitcoin, but what does his timing tell us?
Bitcoin's launch during the 08' financial crisis was not coincidental. Satoshi had been coding Bitcoin for the last 2 years. Let's look at the sequence of events
**12)** Jan - July: Fed tries to stop the housing bust: Fed bails out Bear Sterns. Paulson explains the need to bail out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac the two agencies that held or guarantee 50% of the $12T in US mortgages.
**13)** Aug 18: Satoshi registers [org](http://Bitcoin.org)
Sept 15: Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history ($600B)
Sept 17: Investors withdrew a record $144B from their money market accounts. During a typical week, only about $7B is withdrawn
**14)** Oct 3: Bitcoin whitepaper PDF likely created
Oct 13: Treasury Secretary Paulson talks with 9 major bank CEOs. The total bailout package ~$2.25T
Oct 21:  Fed lends $540B to bail out money market funds
Oct 31: Satoshi publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper
**15)** With the 2008 financial crisis, trust had been lost in a world that ran on trust. Bitcoin was launched in a time of absolute necessity, Satoshi planted the seed at precisely the right moment. The world didn't need a new VISA, they needed an alternative to banks.
**16)** So we now have an idea of Satoshi's motivations, how he describes Bitcoin, and his timing, what about this initial audience for the whitepaper? How did he market his message?
**17)** Satoshi crafted the whitepaper as a call to arms for his target audience: the Cypherpunks on the cryptography mailing list. Key components of their ideology are privacy and finality. His message needed to resonate with them as they would have to help him build it.
**18)** "Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy." - A Cypherpunk's Manifesto
**19)** Many point to this in the whitepaper "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments" as proof that Satoshi meant for Bitcoin's main purpose is to disrupt VISA. However, "cash" represents a pseudonymous push payment in contrast to a credit-based system
**20)** Cash is a bearer asset. Let's look at the whitepaper with that in mind: _"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic [bearer assets] that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."_
**21)** Note that the origin of the word "cash" is "caisse" (French) meaning money-box. So cash is by definition store-of-value. Other Cypherpunks had used the word cash in their whitepapers to reflect that functionality, like "HashCASH", "eCASH", etc"
**22)** In the other part of the whitepaper sentence the phrase "peer-to-peer" has been used as well against the SoV narrative. Charlie Lee has a great tweet storm that addresses this point of contention:
**23)** "Bitcoin isn't "peer-to-peer." Payments are sent from sender to miners, who record it on a distributed ledger. The recipient receives the payment when it's recorded. BUT, this is facilitated by a p2p network where transactions are broadcasted."[@SatoshiLite](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite)
**24)** "Lightning network payments, on the other hand, are p2p payments. They are sometimes direct p2p, sometimes indirect p2p. LN payments have to be sent from p2p to get from the sender to the recipient. Both have to be online, just like other p2p networks like BitTorrent"
**25)** "Bitcoin with Lightning Network more closely fits the Bitcoin whitepaper's title: "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This is Satoshi's Vision." -[@SatoshiLite](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite)
**26)** He wrote the paper to fit his target audience, but the source code implementation were his product specs. "If the Bitcoin Whitepaper is the Declaration of Independence, the Source Code is the Constitution" -[@pierre_rochard](https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard)
**27)** "The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the sourcecode is coming soon." — Satoshi Nakamoto
Aka the whitepaper was marketing, the important details are coming.
**28)** In true Cypherpunk fashion, Satoshi's whitepaper was quickly followed by code release in January 2009. The notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list.
**29)** Just focusing on the whitepaper is a gross misinterpretation, here are the things not described in the whitepaper, but included in the source code or later defined by Satoshi: 21M hard cap, 10 minute blocks, 1 mb block caps.
**30)** If Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to first be used as a medium of exchange to purchase goods and services, he would have made it inflationary. People don't spend deflationary currencies when they can make the same purchase in infl. curr. There's even a name for It, Gresham's Law
**31)** Which is entirely intuitive. Why would any average consumer spend their Bitcoin with the perception that it will be worth more in the future when they can spend their fiat that they KNOW will be worth less?
**32)** So far that doesn't sound like he's trying to disrupt VISA now does it? And if that wasn't made perfectly clear, he permanently etched this message into the Genesis Block:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
**33)** To take it a step further, as a subtle jab to central banks, he chose his birthday as the date the US made gold ownership illegal through EO 6102 April 5th. He chose 1975 as his year of birth which is the year when the US citizens were allowed to own gold again
**34)** And finally, why did Satoshi choose to be anonymous if he were just disrupting payments?
What he was trying to accomplish was clear, he wanted to build a new backbone for the financial system. Bitcoin isn't merely digital cash, but an alternative to banks.
**35)** And how does a new money get created? A new money comes into existence through stages: Collectible, SoV, MoE, and UoA.
SoV and MoE aren't mutually exclusive. It's about where in the cycle of appreciation we're in. At maturity, the payment use case finally makes sense.

**36)** Some may balk at the SoV terminology for Bitcoin since the price fluctuates. However, nothing in this life has a "stable" value, the longest running fiat currency, GBP, has lost 99% of its value since inception. Bitcoin has all the traits of a good SoV
**37)** Bitcoin is stable. The protocol has a 99.99989% uptime which is higher than USD. The "fluctuation" you see is the volatility of the world flowing into the stability of Bitcoin in ebbs and flows.
**38)** When applying "The Szaboian Theory of Money Origins" to Bitcoin, it is reasonable to conclude we just barely left the "collectible phase" and are now witnessing it's first steps into "Proto-money"[@Willem_VdBergh](https://twitter.com/Willem_VdBergh) [@NickSzabo4](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4)
**39)** This phase, which is characterized by its primordial exploration of the SoV properties of the commodity, can easily take a decades to properly mature. Volatility is part of this maturing process.
**40)** People pushing the MoE narrative at this moment in time are counterproductive to adoption. By creating these expectations, which are unattainable at the moment, many people will get burned or disillusioned. This is a big loss for adoption and for the affected individuals

**41)** "Only by informing people correctly about the use case Bitcoin has *at this moment* can we maximize it's adoption and prevent a lot of people from making the biggest financial mistake of their life."[@Willem_VdBergh](https://twitter.com/Willem_VdBergh)
**42)** So how did the payments narrative become a thing?
A/ Satoshi used it to attract the cypherpunks
B/ HODLing isn't good for business. In order to command higher valuations, startups latched onto narratives that VCs would fund. And in 2013-2016 that was "merchant processing."
**43)** Background on me: I was the first PM [@Blockchain](https://twitter.com/blockchain) and [@ChangeTip](https://twitter.com/ChangeTip), both attempted to get people to use Bitcoin for payments. Consumers couldn't care less, which is entirely intuitive: right now it's not faster, cheaper, or easier to use for 99.99% of use cases.
**44)** After all of this do you really think Bitcoin was primarily built for payments at this stage in its lifecycle?
