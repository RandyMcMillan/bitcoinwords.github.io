# Goals and Scope
![CW Logo](/assets/images/cy19q1/words-blue-box-logo.png){: .align-left} Crypto Words is a quarterly journal of cryptocurrency, or crypto, established February 13, 2019. Its purpose is to document and advance commentary and research in disciplines of particular interest to the crypto community. The journal is broad in scope, publishing content from original research, essays, blog posts, and tweetstorms from a wide variety of fields, especially governance, technology, philosophy, politics, and economics, but also legal theory, history, criticism, and social or cultural analysis. Its broader mission is to capture the conversations and think pieces in the crypto space for current and future researchers. Crypto Papers hopes to continue and expand the tradition established by publications such as the [Journal of Libertarian Studies](http://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=3) and [Libertarian Papers](http://libertarianpapers.org/).

## History

There exists a gap in crypto publishing.  For authors with commentary and scholarly papers on crypto topics, the choice of publication outlets is relatively limited. The number of journals that serve as outlets for crypto research is in any event too small, as the number of crypto thinkers continues to grow with every market cycle.

This generation of crypto thinkers have limited places to submit thought pieces for publication. Content is scattered across the web, and in some cases behind paywalls which prevent the free flow of information. With the advent of the Twitter and blogging, authors also now have the option of self-publishing: they post the content to their own site or some private site, link it in a blog post, or post a working paper. But this is obviously not the best way to document and publish. What is needed is a journal that takes full advantage of the possibilities of the digital age as a go to resource for think pieces in the crypto space.

Enter Crypto Words. Published independently, Crypto Words is a quarterly journal that welcomes submissions on a range of topics of interest to the crypto community.  In addition to conventional research articles, we welcome review essays blog posts, tweets as well as papers in other formats, such as distinguished lectures. Finally, wherever possible, content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Crypto Words is open access, and we encourage readers to “[read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles…or use them for any other lawful purpose.](https://doaj.org/faq#definition)” We want our ideas read, spread, and copied.

## My thoughts on the state of crypto in 2018 and where we’re headed
### By [Arjun Balaji](https://medium.com/@arjunblj)
### Posted January  1, 2019

What exploring cryptocurrencies in 2018 feels like.
As another year wraps up, I started writing an email to close friends and investors on the “state of crypto” and my forecasts. As it got longer, it turned into this sprawling post. A few notes:
- This write up contains wide-ranging theses and obvious biases (my own) and is by no means authoritative. Please don’t nitpick.
- Where I make predictions, I try to be as specific as possible (inspired by [SlateStarCodex’s format](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/06/predictions-for-2018/)). Not all predictions are quantifiable. Some will be off and many will likely be directionally incorrect. That’s OK.
- Unless otherwise specified, my criteria for a liquid, actively-traded project “dying” is either (1) < $100k volume/$20m market cap or (2) primary development abandoned, whichever comes first.
- None of these predictions are normative; in many cases I see momentum in products or approaches I consider fundamentally flawed. C’est la vie—this is an attempt at a descriptive 2019 outlook.

### Bitcoin

**1)** After a strong launch in 2018, I see Lightning Network growth continuing into 2019. I predict the number of Lightning nodes with channels will be ≥ 10,000 from ~ [2,100 now](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning) (60% confidence) due to the proliferation of node hardware and hosted solutions (e.g. [Nodl.it](http://nodl.it/), [Casa’s node](https://keys.casa/lightning-bitcoin-node/)) and easy-to-deploy GUIs like Pierre Rochard’s [node launcher](https://github.com/PierreRochard/node-launcher). I predict network capacity will increase even more from ~$2m notional to ≥ $25m+ notional (75% confidence) due to the lifting of maximum channel limits, dual-funded channels, etc.
**2)** At least one major exchange will launch a Lightning Network hub for their users as confidence in the stability and security of the network grows over 2019 (50% confidence). If this occurs, my money is on Binance given their iteration speed and product chops or Coinbase, due to increased focus on adoption and “usage” of cryptocurrencies. I’m particularly excited about Cash App’s potential here given 1) they’re a business that understands Bitcoin 2) Jack sees Bitcoin as [a path to “financial inclusion”](https://twitter.com/jack/status/958743238512328704) and 3) Jack’s [investment in](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/) Lightning Labs’ 2018 seed round.
**3)** A working implementation of [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496/), for which Pieter Wuille released a [draft BIP](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) in July, will make its way into Bitcoin via soft fork by the end of 2019 with ≥ 5% node adoption (75% confidence).
**4)** Low volatility and lower prices always attracts concern trolls and people who believe they can “change” Bitcoin for the better. **The last two years have seen a lot of forks where the codebase is changed but the UTXO set is kept intact. In 2019, I expect to see the opposite: forks with technology kept intact (to merge future upstream changes) where the monetary policy or UTXO set is modified**; an example being the Zclassic team forking Zcash to remove the Founder’s Reward). I predict 2019 will see a major fork proposal from Bitcoin OGs “fixing” post-block reward fee market sustainability either by re-appropriating Satoshi’s Bitcoin (e.g. [my tongue-in-cheek tweet-proposal](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/984114265878614018) for “Bitcoin Freedom”) or by adding predictable, low inflation in favor of the fee-market (50% confidence).
**5)** 2018 was a big year for Bitcoin privacy and fungibility R&D, with proposals for Taproot and Graftroot from Gregory Maxwell in Q1, a draft BIP for the Dandelion protocol in May, and an emergent path for a soft fork upgrade to Schnorr-based signatures. By the end of 2019, there will be a clear roadmap for “good enough” fungibility and privacy on Bitcoin’s base layer across a meaningful set of trade-offs (e.g., speed, confidence level, etc.) (50% confidence).
**6)** 2018 saw [plenty of promising experiments](https://yalls.org/) building products around, with, and on top of Lightning. I anticipate 2019 will see significantly improved UX for developers who want to build with Bitcoin, including [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)/[Truffle-like](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) Javascript wrappers, hosted node services, better docs, tutorials, etc. which makes me very excited about the potential for new products.
  
### Ethereum

**7)** 2018 was a big year for proof of stake research with [June’s deprecation](https://medium.com/@djrtwo/casper-%EF%B8%8F-sharding-28a90077f121) of [EIP 1011](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1011) (Hybrid Casper FFG), scrapping the hybrid PoW/PoS step in favor of moving to pure PoS. The next phase for Ethereum—first termed Shasper (Casper + Sharding), now called Serenity (Ethereum 2.0)—has [six distinct phases](https://github.com/ethhub-io/ethhub/tree/master/ethereum-roadmap/serenity-phases), which stretch over several years. There are 8+ dev teams working on independent implementations including:
- ChainSafe Systems, building a [JS implementation](https://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/lodestar_chain) called Lodestar
- 50-person ConsenSys-backed PegaSys, building an [enterprise-grade implementation](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon) in Java
- An independent group called Harmony, building a [Java implementation](https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-harmony) based on the original EthereumJ client
- Parity Technologies, building an [Ethereum 2.0 client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum) in Rust
- Prysmatic Labs, building a [Go client](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) (recently, Raul Jordan [announced](https://twitter.com/raulitojordan/status/1079085816209649664) the team had full test coverage with the latest spec)
- Sigma Prime, building a [2.0 client](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) in Rust
- Status, makers of the Ethereum-based [messaging app](https://status.im/), building the first [mobile-native client](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus) in the language Nim
- Trinity, a team predominantly backed by the Ethereum Foundation, building [a client](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm) in Python
Despite seeing major setbacks and changes to the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, I think the first phase will ship some time in Q4 2019 (70% confidence), albeit with friction.
**8)** Augur, whose launch everyone awaited with bated breath, seems to have gained little traction (outside of niche markets around the election). I suspect it will be the breakout dApp of 2019, leaping from [~$1.5-2m notional at stake](https://predictions.global/) to ≥ $10m (70% confidence). My bullishness is due to (1) a full year elapsing with a working product (2) improved UX/choice of clients (3) increased brand awareness (4) demand in the market for a non-custodial prediction market (5) stablecoin integration and (6) better market-making and liquidity provisioning.
**9)** The “crypto-collectibles” narrative which gained major steam in Q1/Q2 (peaking in March’s [$12m raise for Cryptokitties](https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-12-million-funding-for-ethereum-app-cryptokitties)) will lose traction despite the orthogonal interest for tradable in-game items. While collectibles [are interesting](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/nfts-what-are-they-good-for), they feel like a solution looking for a problem (though worth noting: I’m not a tastemaker) and gamer adoption feels like a pipe-dream as companies are unlikely to replace their existing monopolies. I suspect several of 2018’s niche “X-for-Y” Cryptokitties imitators that are less well-funded will shut down next year (85% confidence).
**10)** Despite the hype going into the new year, consumer adoption of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have materially lagged expectations. Relayers leveraging 0x — viewed by many as the best exchange protocol — in aggregate have traded < [$2m notional](https://0xtracker.com/) most days in 2018. I predict December 2019’s aggregate volume on 0x will lag a single day’s volume from Coinbase (90% confidence). **The big problem with DEX adoption in 2018 is that it's unclear who the target user is.**
While non-custodial trading feels like a boon, the trade-offs presented (e.g. in matching/execution speed, the potential for front-running, decreased privacy, the difficulty of accounting, etc.) make it an unappealing product for institutional investors, not even considering the UX curve. Whether retail investor participation will be sufficient for long-term sustainability remains to be seen. In addition, many DEX protocols with fee-based tokens will get forked (like 0x has [by their top relayer](https://medium.com/@ivangbi/hydro-protocol-forking-0x-ddex-to-move-on-governance-and-cartels-inb-a16z-a59b463de20a)), though I predict we'll see a surge in cross-chain swaps and similar non-custodial trading options sans token.
**11)** A lot of early prominent projects promised new types of markets, e.g. for [computation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/golem-network-tokens/) or [storage](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/storj/). Along with the “utility token” narrative, demand for these solutions appears dead, as it’s unclear whether (1) demand for un-censorable XYZ is compelling enough given increased cost relative to centralized alternatives or (2) any of these new marketplaces will be sufficiently bootstrapped to hit the economies of scale necessary for their adoption. Not a single one of the new decentralizing marketplaces promising to marshal distributed or idle resources pose a threat to AWS, Microsoft, Dropbox, etc.
**12)** I anticipate we’ll see major pushback from disenfranchised ETH miners, who will propose a contentious hard-fork (60% confidence). Ethereum’s roadmap is already relatively antagonistic to miners: January’s planned Constantinople upgrade (which, among other changes, reduces block rewards from 3 to 2) hurts miners currently at the margin, likely putting them out of business. While a supply reduction is generally bullish, the upgrade may be short-term bearish (given increased miner inventory sales) if it’s not already priced in.
**13)** “Governance tokens” will be less popular than ever by the end of 2019. To me, they appear misaligned incentive-wise: in practice, it feels like rational token holders should be oriented around (1) entrenching existing power structures (as original token holders have out-sized sway in future protocol decisions, including future value-capture design) and (2) maximizing token value rather than what’s often cited as the goal (maximizing token utility). The excitement around the governance token (e.g. “We don’t need to worry about value-capture, we just need to build something worth governing.”) was a by-product of a never-before-seen crypto bull market and will warrant meaningful skepticism in 2019 (60% confidence).
**14)** On the face of it, decentralized finance (a.k.a. “DeFi” or “Open Finance”), a dominant narrative of Ethereum in 2018, is compelling to me in spite of my Bitcoin bias. A goal of the cryptocurrency movement has always been to increase financial inclusion and the core premise of the “DeFi” movement—to provide crypto-native financial products to the unbanked—has obvious appeal. However, I don’t understand what product market fit looks like for the vast majority of “DeFi” products.

If these products (in many cases, novel non-custodial derivatives or leverage-oriented lending products) are designed for institutions, I struggle to understand how they’ll achieve product market fit for many of the reasons posed in 10 on DEXs. Bootstrapping liquidity will be extremely difficult (i.e., I don’t want to trade an exotic non-custodial derivative with no liquidity and it’s unlikely a marginal trader will want to do the same— the classic chicken-and-egg problem). If these products are designed for retail investors, I don’t understand the product market fit either. The long-shot thesis may be that the globally unbanked are looking for easy entry points that DeFi can solve, e.g. exposure to US capital markets/equities with synthetic on-chain [CFDs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp), but I am doubtful. Most consumers in the world don’t have meaningful savings, mirroring Vanguard-type indices or more complex derivatives doesn’t feel like the right entry point for global adoption.

I believe some of the US-based teams working on the DeFi stack are taking on material risk and will face regulatory scrutiny in the US (70% confidence) given their move into structured products. This will test the runaway killer app of Ethereum: regulatory arbitrage (first with the offering of unregistered securities offerings and now with quasi-legal structured derivatives), as teams “move fast and break [the law].”
**While engineers are discussing “[compounding financial primitives](https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1049471953914945536),” I’m worried about compounding technical (or legal) risk.**

### Other Projects

**15)** Two years after pseudonymous Tom Elvis Jedusor posted a paper outlining the Mimblewimble architecture to the #bitcoin-wizards IRC channel, 2 different implementations, [Grin](https://grin-tech.org/) and [BEAM](https://www.beam.mw/#!), are set to launch in Q1 2019. Both subscribe to different design philosophies, from Grin’s Bitcoin-like immaculate conception to BEAM’s Zcash-like foundation model, in addition to differences in monetary policy, stance on ASICs, etc. I expect both will be meaningful in 2019’s privacy wars, with Grin seizing the lion’s share (≥ 70%) of market interest in Mimblewimble (75% confidence). Though its monetary policy isn’t ideal for early adopters due to high early inflation, it wouldn’t surprise me if it finishes ≥ $250m market cap (60% confidence).
**16)** Given both comments from Zooko about both [PoS](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1047133152592846848) and the [Zcash Founder's Reward](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1058351592464887808) and rumblings from the community, I think it's possible that (1) Zcash plans a multi-year transition to propose a move to a hybrid PoW/PoS system (50% confidence) or that (2) a change to the Founder's Reward (30% confidence) takes place. As the Founder’s Reward runs out in 2020, with a lot of research and engineering work left, I can see a proposal to extend it (or lengthen the reward beyond 2020) emerging.
**17)** It's not a secret [I've been hoping](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1029784219239804928) most un-differentiated “means-of-exchange” tokens (e.g. $IOTA, $DASH, $BCN, $XVG, etc.) will die for some time. With the exception of Litecoin (which has the benefit of an old brand, widespread integration, and Bitcoin “test-net” status) and Dogecoin (which will never die), I expect ≥ half these un-differentiated payment tokens will be flushed out over the next year (70% confidence) as (1) 2018’s price action shows they are subject to the same volatility issues as Bitcoin (2) growth of the Lightning Network dampens need for a “faster Bitcoin” (3) they don’t have interesting innovation keeping a large community engaged the same way other public blockchains do with privacy (e.g. Monero, Grin) or ecosystem products (e.g. Ethereum, EOS, Tezos).
**18)** From the days of the Silk Road, dark net markets (DNMs)—along with pornography—have been a hot bed for cryptocurrency innovation. DNMs have gotten [more sophisticated than ever](https://opaque.link/post/dropgang/), moving from centrally-run sites with single points of failure (e.g. DNS shut-down) to decentralized infrastructures, spider webs of Telegram chats and bots, and better reputation systems. There are still problems: bitcoins are still the pre-eminent cryptocurrency of choice (given lack of customer awareness) despite the lack of better, more private options and the fiat-to-bitcoin conversion is a honeypot for law enforcement agents.
It’s no secret I don’t think there are many real use cases of “blockchain” outside of quasi-legal applications. While it’s directionally clear that the future of DNMs is in moving to a fully decentralized stack (with smart-contract-based escrows, etc.), the lack of privacy on most public blockchains makes this a pipe-dream for 2019. Despite this, DNMs serve as an important crypto mind virus entry-point for many—a painkiller rather than a vitamin.
**19)** With greater focus on the “fairness” of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it’s inevitable we will see new distribution-focused blockchain experiments. While [I’m less enthused](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1036282302492549120), 2019 will likely be the year a Valley-based blockchain project focused on the long-standing goal of “getting crypto in the hands of everyone in the world” comes out. This form of UBI (inb4 “universal blockchain income”) is compelling to many and will have some traction as cryptocurrency mind-share has exploded beyond its libertarian-anarchist roots to include ideologies across the political spectrum.
**20)** $XRP, err, I mean Ripple Labs, Inc. will get a small fine/slap on the wrist from the appropriate regulatory authorities, who will finally confront the fact that [it’s probably an unregistered security](https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1065804676690518017) (80% confidence). Thanks to the regulator-revolving-door, [Ben Lawsky](https://twitter.com/BenLawsky) (a.k.a. Architect of the BitLicense: The World’s Worst Crypto Regulation) is [now on their board](https://www.notion.so/arjunblj/Crypto-Theses-for-2019-0b7f6352c3194814aac9a577e6c43f6c). While it’s unlikely anyone’s going to jail, it’s hard to see Ripple’s egregiousness let them off scot-free.
**21)** Bitcoin Cash [split in 2018](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/11/04/summing-up-the-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-debate/), with factions ABC and Satoshi’s Vision (SV) emerging. While the ABC camp has kept the $BCH ticker, BCHSV lives on. With Bitmain potentially seeing internal issues (rumored layoffs, balance sheet issues, IPO delays) and Craig Wright willing to [see “2014 prices”](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1062752448660541440) to win, this could continue on despite the fact that no one cares. I’m more optimistic about Bitmain’s business than most people, but think that Bitcoin’s dominance v. both forks will grow from today (80% confidence). I also expect ABC’s dominance v. SV (~64% right now) will grow to > 80% by the end of the year (70% confidence). Despite my qualms about Bitmain’s strategic decisions, “Don’t start a hash war with Bitmain” might be as prescient as “Never fight a land war in Asia.”
**22)** 2018 was a big year for Bitcoin forks with Bitcoin’s December peak sparking imitators like Bitcoin Gold ($233m market cap), Bitcoin Diamond ($140m market cap), and Bitcoin Private ($41m market cap). They're all currently Top 25 in market cap and have survived everything from [51% attacks](http://fortune.com/2018/05/29/bitcoin-gold-hack/) and [exposés of covert pre-mines](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private/), but I think they’re unlikely to stay in the top 25 by the end of the year (70% confidence, lest the crypto market's extreme inefficiency fails me).
**23)** Both EOS and Stellar have committed a significant amount of time to building out developer experience and core infrastructure over 2018. Despite [my skepticism](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/07/why-do-we-take-eos-seriously-when-its-clearly-a-plutocracy/) of their potential to be internet money, there’s interest from some dev teams globally to interface with these networks [for decentralized applications](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/21/eos-is-a-dao/). The groups hacking on both networks are extremely well-funded. While they aren’t seen by many in the crypto cognoscenti as “legit” projects, some SV energy might push them to meaningful developer adoption (50+ launched dApps) in 2019.
**24)** I’ve been [whistling with schadenfreude](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1029361436122857472) on “masternodes” for some time. They were the perfect bull market trade: lock up more and more coins as prices go up (even more right-tail vol thanks to the smaller float) but we haven’t seen a true unwinding/liquidity crunch despite the drawdown. I would be very surprised if any masternode projects outside of DASH have the liquidity or community backing to extend life to 2020 (40% confidence… sigh).
**25)** [Token curated registries](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-1-2-0-tcrs-new-theory-and-dev-updates-34c9f079f33d), once the hottest “crypto-economic primitive” on the scene, make less sense to me now than they did before 2018. They strike me as a prime example of 2017’s excesses (and desire to tokenize everything). The model feels extremely convoluted and it wouldn’t surprise me to see the industry move away from the TCR en masse (60% confidence).
**26)** Formal on-chain governance, which saw significant hype in 2017 from projects like [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), [Decred](https://decred.org/), and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) left a lot to be desired. While the goal of formal governance systems is to enable smooth upgrades with input from a range of stakeholders, most suffer from elementary issues, cementing plutocratic regimes rather than enabling open participation. Most experiments with formal governance feel primitive due to the lack of proper tooling (e.g. for anonymous voting). There were some new announcements, including Commonwealth Labs’ [work with Edgeware](https://medium.com/commonwealth-labs/meet-edgeware-25e881e4a37e) (a chain on Parity Substrate) but the long-term viability of formal governance systems remains unclear. In 2019, I think we’ll see some non-trivial core protocol decisions decided on-chain for the first time.
**27)** One thing to be more excited about: with more research in formal governance systems, DAOs could make a comeback over the course of 2019. Widely written off as a failed concept due to [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_%28organization%29), two years later, there are new attempts. One DAO launch which looked cool this year is the [Moloch DAO](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch), which aims to contribute to Ethereum infrastructure and solve the tragedy of the commons problem in the ecosystem’s open-source (infrastructure) development. I’ve [stated before](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1021832335510126593) that “crypto projects should have a plan to dissolve into some future decentralized governance model.” I see crypto projects re-architecting Swiss foundations into DAOs as the first potential “killer use case” and think we will see iterations of this in 2019.

### Private Projects

*Note: I'm not an investor in any of the projects or companies mentioned in this section.*

**28)** Despite sustained drawdowns in public crypto markets, private valuations (particularly for projects coming from Silicon Valley) haven't quite adjusted. Fred Wilson [recently noted](https://www.inc.com/fred-wilson/2019-public-private-markets-uber-lyft-slack-ipo.html) the relationship between public market valuations in the equities market:
> There is a big difference between the private markets and the public markets. They do not move in lockstep. For years now, the late-stage private markets have been trading at valuations that are well in excess of their public market comps. That is true for a number of reasons. First, private market investors have longer time horizons and are looking for a three to five year return, not an immediate one. Second, private market investors get a liquidation preference which in theory protects them from losses. 
>**Finally, deals in the private markets clear in an auction like environment where the highest bidder wins the deal. All of these factors mean that a hot company can raise capital in the private markets at valuations well in excess of where they can raise capital (and trade) in the public markets.**
Most compelling for crypto is the last argument: starved for alpha, [investors pattern-matched](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/994602050372755456) to find “the next Ethereum.” While several crypto-funds still have these investments marked at cost, it’s hard to believe investments made at ≥ $500m valuations (and in many cases, in excess of $1b) will represent gains for investors when the broad public crypto-market has drawn down so significantly. In 2019, I expect that many teams will re-raise at lower valuations or see material drawdowns when listing (90% confidence).
**29)** Some of these networks include Dfinity, Hashgraph, Algorand, Filecoin, Ncent, Thunder Token, etc. I anticipate less than 50% of these networks will launch in 2019 (70% confident).
**30)** The last quarter of 2017 and the first half of 2018 saw sky-high private valuations thanks to a potent combination of new crypto fund/whale money and a path to liquidity that divorced fundamentals and due-diligence in favor of memes and FOMO. As fast paths to liquidity have all but disappeared, I anticipate we’ll see projects return to more “traditional” approaches to raising money (read: equity) and focus on protocol-adjacent business models rather than building new base-layer protocols.
**31)** A launch of [Handshake](https://www.handshake.org/) ([technical overview](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-didnt-know-about-the-handshake-naming-system-how-this-blockchain-project-will-483464309f33)) could be an interesting 2019 development. Though I’m skeptical of their need for a token, replacing the ICANN root server is an interesting problem and it’s clear the current DNS/Certificate Authority system is broken. One potential 2019 development: Handshake serves as a crude but effective solution for sites with regulatory or speech-related risk, which is enough to serve as an effective bootstrapping mechanism.
**32)** One thing I’m not looking forward to in 2019: the battle of messaging app crypto-tokens, with Telegram (TON), Signal (Mobilecoin), and even Whatsapp jumping into the fray. While none of them are interesting as a potential non-sovereign money competitor, I’m most interested in seeing what Facebook does: a [stablecoin designed for remittance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers) could make a meaningful impact while on-boarding millions of people to the cryptocurrency UX (as well as normalizing it in India, a country which [has had 2018 legal bouts](http://fortune.com/2018/02/01/bitcoin-price-india/) around Bitcoin). I’m least excited for Telegram Open Network, who had a [red-hot $1b sale](https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-doubles-amount-raised-in-ico-to-1-7-billion) on the backs of crypto mania, Telegram's traction, and many many pages of techno-babble.

### Stablecoins

**33)** 2018 was definitely “year of the stablecoin” with Paxos Standard’s [PAX](https://www.paxos.com/standard/), Gemini’s [GUSD](https://gemini.com/dollar/), Circle’s [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), Carbon’s [CUSD](https://fiat.carbon.money/), and TrustToken’s [TUSD](https://blog.trusttoken.com/trueusd-a-usd-backed-stablecoin-you-can-trust-9688796cfd0d); though none of these are true decentralized stablecoins (I prefer the term “price-stable asset backed token” or “fiat-coin” if that’s a mouthful).
Since these tokens allow traders to treat exchanges like banks, it should be no surprise that [they are under KYC/AML-scrutiny](https://www.americancryptoassociation.com/2018/12/30/paxos-standard-hassling-ethereum-traders-trying-to-redeem-stablecoin-pax-for-dollars/), like banks. **Fiat-coins are not permission-less**, though [aggregating demand for the product](https://www.tonysheng.com/fiatcoins-aggregators) at the exchange-layer makes perfect strategic sense for exchanges. Even the briefest taint of an unsavory transaction can charge Tyler and Cameron to personally shut down your account.
Holding fiat-coins leaves you at the whim of the issuer to control your financial fate: we’ve just swapped one God for another. While [Tether dominance](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/tether-dominance-drops-to-new-3-year-low-as-other-stablecoins-gain-traction/) has fallen to new lows due to concerns over credit risk and the emergence of these new projects, it’s unclear what product market fit for fiat-coins looks like. Is the use-case as an intermediary safe-haven or settlement currency for traders? Is it a new “digital dollar” with its own ecosystem of products?
In 2019, I anticipate Tether’s dominance of the fiat-coin ecosystem dips below < 50% (75% confidence) with total fiat-coin (counting TUSD, USDT, USDC, PAX, GUSD) exceeds 4b in market-cap from ~2.5b now (80% confidence).
**34)** Despite my reservations about the long-term viability of the model, [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) saw serious growth in 2018 (with [~1.8m ether locked](https://mkr.tools/system) as of this post). While the system is robust—a by-product of excess collateralization in the system (currently ~370%)—use generally seems limited to demand for margin in ether, though the team has shared other [use cases for CDPs](https://medium.com/makerdao/dai-cdp-user-stories-36735f095fda). Continued deposits of ether in CDPs [have affected ether price](https://medium.com/@deepitag/ether-deflation-as-caused-by-makerdao-part-3-a-spur-of-the-moment-analysis-39d0d0d51720), it wouldn't surprise me to see ether in CDPs exceed 3% of total ether in 2019 (60% confident) though less volatile collateral or the emergence of centralized options like [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) may be more appealing.
**35)** After marquee stablecoin project Basis [returned money to investors](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/12/stablecoin-project-basis-is-shutting-down-and-returning-the-majority-of-capital-raised-to-investors/), we lost one of the most interesting experiments in cryptocurrencies. Is it possible for a group of venture capitalists and clever twenty-somethings to bootstrap a price-stable currency based purely on belief (spoiler: probably not for now)? Despite the set-back, teams like [Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol) are working on similar [seignorage shares](https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins/blob/master/paper.pdf) models with plans on decentralizing over time. I think it’s unlikely we see a a seigniorage shares-based stablecoin project launch with > $1b in total issuance in 2019 (80% confidence).
**36)** Fear over Tether’s backing was higher than ever in 2018 with concerns about [banking relationships](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-02/bank-tied-to-tether-goes-quiet-on-relationship-with-crypto-firm), [enablement of price manipulation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-20/bitcoin-rigging-criminal-probe-is-said-to-focus-on-tie-to-tether), and a constant [stream of concerns](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-so-called-tether-audit-that-isnt-an-audit-at-all-5a40cfcc2a75) over a proper “audit” of funds (though this may be [impossible to provide in any conclusive way](https://twitter.com/winklevoss/status/1052581201763033088)). The year ended with a [Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised) hinting that all the reserves may in fact be there. I predict it’s highly likely Tether in fact has all the US dollar deposits they claim they do (85% confidence) but that due to other investigations around criminal activity (e.g. money laundering, market manipulation, etc.), consumers may have their funds locked by authorities in a long withdrawal process, [similar to online poker sites](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2016/04/black-friday-five-years-later-24506.htm) after the infamous “Black Friday” (30% confidence).

### Crypto-funds

**37)** My favorite fundamental indicator is still price action. Earlier this year, [I said](https://tokendaily.co/blog/the-best-fundamental-indicator-new-inflows) about crypto funds:
>Early in the cycle, many progressive funds will allocate to managers to “get smart” on the space (see: Passport Capital, Union Square Ventures, a16z, Sequoia, and others allocating to crypto-funds). This comes out of a recognition that **the new asset class is different than the one that they're used to** but could potentially become much more relevant to their strategy ... As initial hype subsides, a second generation of capital allocators will emerge who are more experienced, taking away capital from the gun-slinging fund managers who rode the first wave. It's highly unlikely that the very best fund managers in a new asset class were also the first to spot it. We're starting to see this now, with Matt Huang and Fred Ehrsam's new fund, a16z's newly announced crypto-fund, and several more unannounced funds raising money in today's crypto bear market.

This has roughly held up as new second-generation funds have raised from:
- (1) more credible LPs [including the Yale endowment](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/yale-investment-chief-david-swensen-jumps-into-crypto-with-bets-on-two-silicon-valley-funds.html) 
- (2) with longer lock-ups and 
- (3) more credible GPs.

With that said, I think funding will slow down in 2019 given:

- (1) lack of momentum in public crypto markets 
- (2) limited investable opportunities given the size of the market and 
- (3) proliferation of beta exposure vehicles. The third point is critical: **many of the largest funds are overweight BTC/ETH, with capital allocators paying excessive fees for beta** (particularly with long-only models). While experienced GPs will have no trouble raising and often argue that BTC/ETH allocation is a portfolio decision, I suspect many LPs will opt for exposure directly through low-cost single/multi-asset investment products.

**38)** With the blood this year, the opportunity for crypto fund differentiation finally emerged— though returns look less than stellar ([Vision Hill's benchmarking](https://medium.com/@visionhill_/vision-hill-crypto-hedge-fund-returns-third-quarter-2018-eae2bc831531) was a positive development). More funds are starting to figure out where they “fit” in the landscape (e.g. fundamental long-only v. long/short v. “generalized mining” etc.) v. generically labeling themselves “crypto funds.” I expect we’ll see similar institutionalization in 2019 top-to-bottom of the entire crypto-fund pipeline, from back-office ops to custody. In addition, many funds will be one-and-done after the last year's price action and will see too many redemptions to continue (the death zone AUM-wise is probably ~$25m unless you skimp majorly on services/legal/salaries).
**40)** Investing strategies from traditional capital markets like activist models, e.g. [Layer1](https://www.coindesk.com/peter-thiel-backs-2-1-million-round-for-crypto-investment-startup-layer1)’s, have been extremely under-explored. While early models look something like Blockstream-meets-trading-firm and questions remain (e.g. is a model where wins are socialized but losses are not sustainable?), I’m excited about the development. One activist model I’m particularly interested in seeing: a fund pursuing legal arbitrage to attempt to secure treasuries from projects where the aggregate value of treasury funds exceed market cap. With the current market landscape, creativity is necessary.

### Product Potpourri

**41)** I've been skeptical of enterprise blockchains and promised I wouldn't spend any more time on them after [my experience](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/926096309446209536) at a meet up last year. That said, it looks like corporate interest in capital-b Blockchain is slowing with depressed crypto prices using things like [earnings call mentions](https://medium.com/utopiapress/blockchains-hype-is-dying-according-to-corporate-america-s-s-p-500-earnings-calls-citations-56b97771ce58) as a useful proxy. Who would've thought? Turns out investment in enterprise or "permissioned" blockchain efforts were only cool while crypto prices (and corporate interest) was mooning.

In many cases, we're in Year 3 or 4 of the "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" experiments that started in the aftermath of the 13-14 Bitcoin bubble. We've already started to see the first casualties as [noted execs](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/blythe-masters-wall-streets-best-known-blockchain-cheerleader-resigns-from-digital-asset-holdings.html) are abandoning projects ranging from R3, Hyperledger, and other efforts from Microsoft, IBM, etc. I expect most of these teams to see layoffs or shut down in 2019 (_75% confidence_) on the back of limited adoption and even more limited utility.

**42)** A positive development of 2018 is the number of new, cheap node-in-a-box hardware products, ranging from boutique consumer products like [Coinmine's](https://coinmine.com) to barebones hardware like [Nodl.it](http://nodl.it)'s. While costs range wildly based on feature-richness and form factor and there are concerns about commodification (from an investors' perspective), this is undoubtedly good for users who want self-sovereignty when interacting with public blockchains. The average industry cost for a full-node box should trend to ~$150 USD (though it can be run even more cheaply [on a Raspberry Pi](https://brettmorrison.com/running-a-bitcoin-lightning-full-node-on-raspberry-pi)). 

**43)** Security tokens saw extreme hype going into 2018 with [hundreds](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/harbor-securities-tokenization/) [of](https://cryptoslate.com/tzero-announces-270-million-investment-from-gsr-capital/) [millions](https://polymath.network/) of dollars in investment to exchanges, token standards, issuers, and more. [**My thesis**](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1006521759795851264) **remains steady that nearly all value generated by tokenized securities will be captured by 1) underwriters 2) asset holders [who benefit from the illiquidity premium] 3) early investors in STOs who can arbitrage sophistication 4) infrastructure providers.**

A little STO inside baseball: as it stands, the space has little traction and is teeming with underwriters—who often stand to _directly_ benefit from the deal from advantageous pricing as principal investors _in addition to_ underwriting fees—hyping up future retail investor interest. Incentives are often misaligned.

**Despite grandiose claims of $80T TAMs, I'm skeptical that security tokens have found investor-market-fit.** It's unclear who the "right" audience for STOs is. It's not institutions, who lack any effective way to hedge or manage risk of these long-only products (or take custody, for that matter). Howard Marks' comment in a [2015 letter on liquidity](http://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2015-03-25-liquidity.pdf) comes to mind:

It's one of my standing rules that "No investment vehicle should promise greater liquidity than is afforded by its underlying assets." If one were to do so, what would be the source of the increase in liquidity? Because there is no such source, the incremental liquidity is usually illusory, fleeting and unreliable, and it works (like a Ponzi scheme) until markets freeze up and the promise of liquidity is tested in tough times.

With investor-market-fit uncertain, a potential macro cycle shift, and lack of institutional-grade infrastructure, and the roadmap to deployment looking uncertain, I'm skeptical the world will be tokenized in 2019. I would be surprised if the actively traded market of (novel) tokenized securities exceeds $2b in the next year.

**44)** There are a wide range of different institutional-grade custody offerings funded in Q4/Q1 of last year set to launch in 2019, either with direct self-custody products or by providing the technology back-end for other custodians. I suspect we'll see a major custody product offering from a traditional sell-side firm (excluding Fidelity Digital Assets) by the end of the new year (_60% confidence_). I also think we'll see the first crypto-native custody solution be granted broker-dealer/qualified custodianship status, a major step in the maturation of the asset class (_75% confidence_).

**45)** I'm bullish on efforts like [Lolli](https://lolli.com/) and [Cash App](https://cash.app/), beautiful products from companies who grok consumer UX and are making meaningful strides to help consumers understand and buy, earn, move, and store cryptocurrencies directly. **I suspect these and new consumer products will lead to millions of people interfacing with a cryptocurrency for the first time in 2019.**

### Crypto Companies

**46)** As [described earlier](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1054791943232856064): Coinbase is fighting a multi-front war. Fidelity, Gemini, and a slew of Wall St. firms are competing for any institutional business. In the event there is an STO battleground to fight over, tZero, Templum, Harbor, Securitize, ASX/Malta/Gibraltar, and others are in fray. The profitable consumer business faces constant pressure from Robinhood, Circle, and Binance.

While their regulatory moat remains strong, Coinbase appears to be going into 2019 heavily focused on [increasing consumer usage/adoption](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/0x) and [aggressively expanding token listings](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-continues-to-explore-support-for-new-digital-assets-92ba4ab7f465) (perhaps motivated by dampened trading volume in a crypto bear market). In 2018, Coinbase launched both their [venture arm](https://ventures.coinbase.com/) and [expanded their M&A activity](https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-crypto-bitcoin-acquisition-strategy-emilie-choi-2018-4) (acquiring Paradex,[Earn.com](http://earn.com), and acqui-hiring many smaller teams) in an effort to become the "Google of crypto."

While I'm skeptical of the strategy to list tokens with dubious utility other efforts, a few facts remain true going into 2019: (1) Coinbase is still synonymous with "place to buy crypto" for millions of consumers. (2) They have a war chest to rival many of the largest companies in the space while (3) having a sizable regulatory moat in the US and (4) top-of-the-line product teams (at least relative to other crypto companies).

In 2019, I expect to see continued expansion into crypto-native consumer products that allow consumers to interface directly with protocols in addition to improvements to exchange infrastructure (as the bear market offers ample time to prepare for the next cycle of adoption).

Coinbase has already launched their Earn.com-based "education" service. Other product moves from them could include: a more consumer friendly wallet ([Toshi](https://www.toshi.org/) refreshed) which allows customers to stake and interface with dApps/Lightning, increased focus on lending (Coinbase is a bank after all), and productization of the OTC workflows as they [expand their institutional presence](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-crypto-jobs-hiring) with sales and trading (other OTC desks lack the product and engineering chops).

I also strongly suspect that Coinbase shifts to a more Bitcoin-friendly position in 2019.

**47)** On the subject of exchanges, after a year spent acquiring [fastest unicorn ever](https://medium.com/digital-alchemy-holdings/binance-the-fastest-profitable-unicorn-in-history-d71dc659dc44) status, I suspect Binance will have a much tougher 2019. What Binance has in engineering chops [they forego in regulatory attack surface area](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1000026792269402113) .

I suspect 2019 will see (1) Binance more comprehensively close access to US participants (_75% confidence_) after facing regulatory action (2) launch a full-on DEX (_80_% _confidence_) (3) launch multiple global fiat on-ramps (_80% confidence_) while (4) becoming the dominant exchange in Africa (_90% confidence_). While regulatory action will slow down growth from prospective US customers, I doubt they'll see a full shut-down given their Malta domicile (_30% confidence_). I would peg a prospective shutdown of BitMEX (given shades of market manipulation/excess leverage) significantly higher (_70% confidence_).

**48)** 2018 was the year of the shitty exchange tokens following the runaway success of Binance's token in 2017 (success always breeds imitators), with many resorting to shady "transaction mining" from companies like [Fcoin](https://medium.com/fcoinofficial/a-new-era-of-transaction-mining-is-coming-and-who-will-be-the-winner-27ca6e670b04), [catex](https://www.catex.io/), [ZBG](https://www.zbg.com/), [coinall](https://www.coinall.com/), [coinex](https://www.coinex.com/), [Cashierest](https://www.cashierest.com/), and [abcc](https://abcc.com/) .

This is a new type of scam: instead of taking fees from customers, these shady third-tier exchanges choose to give back the notional value of trading fees to customers in the form of their native exchange token. This is clearly unsustainable, with a couple of these businesses already shutting down.

Many of these native tokens saw huge jumps in initial volumes from curious traders but are now cesspools of wash-trading given easy gamification. Not only does offering a token represent a serious liability, it represents major counterparty risk as the exchange-token scheme could collapse at any moment. I suspect ≥ 75% of the exchanges offering these trans-mining schemes will shut down in 2019 (_85% confidence_).

**49)** Consensys has had a rough year with major drawdowns in ether and other ERC-20 tokens (held in treasury/launched by Consensys subsidiaries), ending the year with [lay-offs](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/12/07/consensys-blockchain-layoffs/) and plans of [spinning off](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150036/consensys-layoffs-employees-pending-startup-ethereum) most of their less-favorite children. This is a bearish sign and I suspect the majority of projects that are spun off will have trouble raising follow-on financing due to cap-table concerns and broader theses shifts in the ecosystem.

**50)** Given Consensys' contributions to Ethereum infrastructure (including [Infura](https://infura.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/), etc.), it raises meaningful questions about the sustainability of open-source development and how important non-core protocol-adjacent work (e.g. developer infrastructure, etc.) will be funded. Historically, we've seen a few different models:

* A company like [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/) or [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering) (taking cues from Docker, Redis Labs, SUSE, and others), focused on delivering value-added services on top of an open-source protocol. While **their primary orientation is profit-seeking, a large part of the company's resources is committed to maintaining the project**. Historically, this has been seen as unsuccessful (if not on an absolute basis, certainly a questionable risk-adjusted bet) for clear reasons: (1) It was unclear for many years what, if any, services would emerge as potential profit centers. (2) Unlike other new technologies (e.g., a web framework or database), a bet directly on the technology, without layered execution risk, is possible. Despite this, some of the largest contributions to Bitcoin have come from similar teams, indicating that their work was integral.
* An exploratory research group like [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/) (which I believe is entirely self-funded), which has free reign to work on anything they'd like. This sort of patronage model allows for intellectual freedom, including hosting "mercenary" contributors or community members like tenured professors. While the freedom is optimal, funding these types of initiatives is often quite difficult: it requires recurring charitable donation.
* A formal "foundation" which has wider-ranging set of responsibilities, including interaction with regulators, organizing the network launch, etc. This is — of course — sub-optimal and unlikely to be of any interest to communities like Bitcoin's (who have historically pushed back against any formal "Foundation" designation given the many charlatans who've attempted to profit).
* Direct fees from a crypto-network used to support core protocol and protocol-adjacent work, the approach taken by teams like Decred and Zcash.

While economists like Elinor Ostrom have tried to [answer this question](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015WJ1C8W/) in other domains, I suspect we'll see significant iteration on different funding models in 2019.

**51)** While the news of [Bakkt's](https://www.bakkt.com) launch (delayed twice) and the announcement of [Fidelity Digital Assets](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com) were eagerly promoted by the broad crypto-community, I suspect their Q1 launches will have less demand than expected with adoption trickling in over the course of the year. It remains ambiguous to me who the anticipated customer is for Bakkt's bitcoin-settled futures product. Fidelity's DNA [appears to be deeply-rooted](https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1060905977422200832) around Bitcoin's cypherpunk roots, they will go a long way to combating common worries around [rehypothecation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2018/08/21/two-things-that-dont-mix-well-bitcoin-rehypothecation-and-chain-forks/#5e8630911e14) during the financialization of Bitcoin.

**52)** [_Disclosure: I'm an advisor to The Block._] 2018 saw the emergence of a number of new media properties (and media-adjacent companies/projects) including [The Block](https://theblockcrypto.com), [Messari](https://messari.io), [BREAKER](https://breakermag.com), [Token Daily](http://tokendaily.co), and [TruStory](https://www.trustory.io/) . While they have various flavors of ideology and differing goals, they all go a long way to legitimizing coverage of an industry plagued with fake news, disingenuous PR, and blatant scams. While regulators have their hands full with low-hanging fruit, these companies are often the first to [expose foul play](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/10/two-identities-one-man-the-story-of-800-million-hedge-fund-fraudster-boaz-manor-who-led-the-alleged-31-million-blockchain-terminal-ico/) — they will continue to play an important role in uncovering the deep underbelly of long-tail crypto projects as the industry continues disciplined self-regulation.

**53)** Bitmain, once the unstoppable inspiration of 1000 "mining is centralized" thought-pieces (a behemoth [staring at a $12b 2018 IPO price](https://www.coindesk.com/report-mining-giant-bitmain-valued-at-12-billion-in-new-funding-round)), doesn't appear to be immune from crypto bear market woes. The bearish case for Bitmain is straightforward: they've suffered immensely from a costly bet on Bitcoin Cash (and an ensuing pissing contest, err, "hash war"), lost some top engineering talent (who are now competitors), and are victims of depressed crypto prices along with other miners. Bitmain has lost technological superiority — their latest, the S15 (23 TH/s) has formidable competition from both BitFury's [Tardis](https://bitfury.com/hardware/tardis) (80 TH/s) and Ebang's [Ebit 11+](http://miner.ebang.com.cn/goods-13.html) (37 TH/s).

Despite additional rumblings that Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan will be replaced with new leadership, I believe Bitmain's obituaries are premature. 2018 saw many people come at the king, though some early competitors are [already shutting down](https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1077852315489513472) due to the difficulty and prohibitive cost of 7nm ASIC manufacturing. Bitmain may [never be Ghash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghash.io) but shutting down this year feels like a long shot (_85% confidence_).

**54)** I've [been](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1066032638622863361) [bearish](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/21/overstocks-been-in-a-tailspin-and-even-its-ceos-optimism-cant-save-the-firm-from-a-lack-of-tokenization/) on Overstock (and tZero's) prospects for some time. I think it's highly likely that Overstock successfully spins out their retail business (_85% confidence_) by 2019's end but that their blockchain efforts continue to sputter given a lack of profitability and slower-than-anticipated adoption of security tokens.

**55)** After seeing the $1b in revenue some OTC trading desks were generating in 2017, banks leapt at the opportunity to capture juicy spreads and generous commissions, most notably led (and later [supposedly shuttered](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-05/cryptos-crash-goldman-suspends-trading-desk-plans)) by Goldman. I suspect demand for Wall St. offerings for spot BTC trading will be ~0 given the existing landscape of institutional-grade options (which execute the majority of spot bitcoin trading). It would surprise me if any tier-one bank opened an OTC spot or derivatives trading desk in 2019 (_50% confidence_).

**56)** A large exchange (top-10 in volume) will be hacked in 2019. The bear market is prime time for hackers, particularly with more fringe exchanges laying off some staff amidst difficulties (_50% confidence_).

**57)** As part of broader market consolidation in the bear market, I think we'll see strategic acquisitions by larger companies or early movers in both on-chain analysis (e.g. Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinmetrics) and custody products like Anchor (_60% confidence_).

**58)** Rage over payment system censorship felt like it reached a tipping point in 2018 with Mastercard (downstream [via Patreon](https://twitter.com/Patreon/status/1029551216886341634)), [SWIFT](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1060718757310619649), and even [PayPal demonstrating](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting) that payment networks like [other web-based messaging services](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/twitter-bans-titania-mcgrath-the-best-twitter-troll-ever/) are susceptible to top-down decisions to cut off free flow of money at any point. Bitcoin can potentially catch a lot of these leaks as we saw with late 2018 examples from fringe social-networks [like Gab](https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1067796591669473280) or [controversial personalities](https://bitcoinist.com/patreon-jordan-peterson-bitcoin/) like Jordan Peterson. I anticipate this trend will continue into 2019.

## Regulation

**59)** 2018 also saw many different proposals (from the BIS, IMF, and others) around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) peaking with [this paper](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf) .

The core argument for CBDCs [some economists make](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/central-banks-take-over-digital-payments-no-cryptocurrencies-by-nouriel-roubini-2018-11) are that by moving private deposits to CBDCs, a more safe narrow-banking system system emerges replacing the current commercial and private banking infrastructure (which in turn allows central banks _greater_ control of the economy). Other economists like Ken Rogoff [have made historical arguments](https://medium.com/chainrift-research/cryptocurrencies-are-intrinsically-worthless-assets-says-professor-of-public-policy-and-economics-abba5fd80ddc) in favor of moving to digital cash systems (phasing out large bills) citing both financial efficiencies and greater oversight into money laundering (and downstream crime).

Personally I find CBDCs terribly uninteresting, another attempt to extend to the financial system's Foucauldian panopticon. "CBDCs, not cryptocurrencies" is just the latest of the already-tiring "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" trend. However with the world largely trending towards digital payments, I think CBDCs in some form are inevitable though I doubt we see large-scale consumer-ready deployments in 2019 (_75% confidence_).

**60)** We've already started to see the first [regulatory](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/sec-imposes-its-first-civil-penalties-for-two-icos-violating-security-registration-laws/) [actions](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/11/17/the-sec-cracks-down-on-two-icos-creates-a-template-for-future-enforcement/) come to ICO teams in 2018, with the SEC going after low-hanging fruit, establishing a clear pattern through the process. While no large projects have faced serious regulatory scrutiny, I anticipate the SEC will shift focus here in 2019 with a top-25 project (by market cap) facing injunction (_60% confidence_).

**61)** 2018 saw more Bitcoin ETF proposals than ever with [SolidX-VanEck Bitcoin Trust](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm), [ProShares Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415311/000119312517380111/d464351ds1a.htm) (they also filed a [Short Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415311/000119312517380111/d464351ds1a.htm)), [GraniteShares Bitcoin ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725554/000149315217014676/forms-1.htm) (corresponding [short ETF](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1725554/000149315217014676/forms-1.htm)), and others, including more esoteric multi-asset ETFs from companies like Bitwise Investments. Despite outstanding concerns over market manipulation of BTC spot prices, I think it's likely we see a Bitcoin spot ETF approved by the end of the year (_70% confidence_), with my bet on VanEck to grab first approval.

**62)** One place we've seen little regulatory action is with "crypto influencers" facing fines or other actions, though regulators have started [clamping down on celebrities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/11/29/floyd-mayweather-and-dj-khaled-were-paid-to-promote-a-fraudulent-ico/#3ebbcc234665) . Naming names is rude, but this SHA-256 hash has my list of influencers that are more likely to get rekd, with a reveal coming in 2020: a6c061624f97399d08fb58dbd23801ab9d03a9329128f5147a9873c9daf906a1

**63)** Along with excitement over CBDCs, I think it's likely some country (likely smaller) will announce a pilot or experiment around a blockchain-based identity system (_50% confidence_).

### Some closing thoughts on prices and adoption

With this year marking the start of a crypto recession, the focus for many technologists has been around _adoption_ and _usage_ .

In my view, the only thing that can drive crypto _adoption_ is (1) bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies serving as an escape valve for people who are in uncertain monetary regimes (and willing to stomach Bitcoin's volatility), e.g. Venezuela, Iran, etc., (2) people buying into the idea that Bitcoin is effectively a call option on becoming a future store-of-value, or (3) people buying the idea that Ethereum, Dfinity, Tezos, and other crypto-networks represent a radical shift in the way computing works ("Web 3.0") ahead of what will likely be a multi-year validation process.

There may be others, but those three things represent to me the majority of factors that could "drive crypto adoption in the short-term."

As people's interest fade and near-term sell pressure drops off (which we've seen over the last several months), we'll enter a prolonged phase of virtual boredom (read: this is right now) which lasts months, if not years, where many spend time speculating on what's "next" for adoption (post-13/14 cycle this was new protocols like Ethereum, merchant/payment processing tools, etc.) while the majority of people involved in the previous bubble leave.

I don't really worry about questions like short-term adoption drivers. People will buy cryptocurrencies for one of the reasons above, or they won't. Gradually as the market bottoms out, prices becomes more appealing and perhaps renewed interest leads to another cycle, serving a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or maybe the price dips below a point of "no confidence" (i.e., BTC prolonged < $1k) at which point no one has faith and only HODLers of last resort are left (like we saw last cycle). Either way though, the digital sound money genie is out of the bottle.

As I've [noted before](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1025091745376337920), **cryptocurrencies are still in the "risk basket" (along with venture capital) for institutional capital allocators.** Particularly considering a broader macro "risk off" scenario over the next 12–18 months, I doubt bitcoin prices will make new all-time-highs in 2019 (_95% confidence_) and think there's a strong chance we don't break $8k BTC (_60% confidence_).

I think it's unlikely that BTC will be a crisis alpha in the next recession the way many people are hoping (I've also noted [my own signs](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1009464256922873857) of late-cycle behavior). That said, the flight-to-quality to bitcoin and other "blue chip" cryptocurrencies will likely continue into 2019.

Either way, I'll be here studying, investing, and sharing my learnings. Whatever small role I can play in the experiments around non-sovereign money is among the most important projects I'll work on in my lifetime.

"Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price." — Hal Finney

Perhaps we can use some of [Hal's ambition](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1057741782065336320) going into 2019.

## What Crypto Can Tell Us About Macro Markets in 2019
### By [Jill Carlson](https://twitter.com/_jillruth)
###Posted January 1, 2019

Over the last quarter, the market has rejected risk assets across the board in a sudden reversal of the year's trend. The S&P 500 erased its 9% gain over a matter of weeks in October. The Nasdaq index retraced from an 18% gain to end the year down 5%.

But no market has felt more pain recently than that of cryptocurrencies. The aggregate market cap of cryptocurrencies, which topped out at $830 billion last January, has since crumbled to $130 billion. Much of this unwind has occurred only in the last two months, with the crypto market as a whole getting marked down over 40% quarter-to-date.

The cryptocurrency market is admittedly miniscule relative to other asset classes. Cryptocurrency (no matter how big the drawdown) is unlikely to have any impact on broader markets any time soon. Bitcoin has demonstrated no substantial correlation to any other asset, whether equities or gold. Nonetheless, what has been happening with this nascent asset class over the last year may reveal some important macro trends.

Two years ago, at the end of 2016, the cryptocurrency market stood at $15 billion in value. Trading volumes across all cryptocurrencies hovered in the double-digit millions. What led to the asymptotic spike in prices over the course of 2017? While it may be possible to point to certain headlines and technology developments as catalysts, most would probably dismiss the phenomenon as a speculative bubble. They may not be wrong in this characterization, but they may also miss the macro context in which all of this occurred.

We have seen many search for yield trades play out over the last 8 years. With central banks around the world pumping liquidity into the economy, traditionally risky assets have seen their premiums sucked out of them. Emerging markets stocks, bonds, and currencies have benefited from this trend. High beta equities, most notably in the tech sector, have boomed with the FAANG stocks leading the way. This trend has also driven money further out along the risk spectrum into alternative asset classes, ranging from art to cars to venture capital.
![image](/assets/images/cy19q1/jill-1.png){: .align-center}
_With rates like these, who needs hedges?_ Image from Pimco's 2016 Negative Interest Rate Report. [https://global.pimco.com/en-gbl/resources/education/investing-in-a-negative-interest-rate-world](https://global.pimco.com/en-gbl/resources/education/investing-in-a-negative-interest-rate-world)

The cryptocurrency boom of 2017 may have been the illogical conclusion of this global search for yield. It certainly followed this trend, starting as money poured into the relatively lower beta cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin and ethereum). Over time capital found its way into brand new assets as well, the products of initial coin offerings (ICOs) into which investors dumped an estimated $20 billion in the last year and a half, often with little in the way of investor rights or protections. Talk about "risk on"...

But the story has changed since then. If you bought bitcoin at the peak last December and sold today you would be realizing an 80+% loss. Many of bitcoin's brethren, including many ICOs, have performed far worse with some cryptocurrencies getting marked down 95+% this year. The last major legs lower of this correction in October and November have coincided with the broader market sell off.

Perhaps cryptocurrency, the last mover on the way up, is the leading indicator of a broader market fall. If the cryptocurrency boom of 2017 was partly the result of the longest expansionary period the economy has seen in a century, perhaps the bursting crypto bubble of 2018 is the canary in the coal mine that the search for yield has run its course.

The recent downturn across asset classes has been blamed on a global growth slowdown, rising interest rates, and continued political uncertainty. Whether this plays out in 2019 remains to be seen, but if it does, it will manifest first as capital leaves what it perceives to be the riskiest assets.

1. 10 years ago today, in an unknown location, a mysterious figure whose identity is still unknown, tapped a key on his keyboard, spurring his CPU into action.
In doing so, Satoshi reified his vision for a decentralized digital cash that he'd published 3 months earlier.
2. The fan in his computer began spinning to keep the CPU, burning from the burden of work it had been given, from overheating.
The CPU in Satoshi's computer was searching for a special pattern, much like a digital needle in a haystack, that would secure [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin)'s first block.
3. Here is that needle:
0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
It is the hash of Bitcoin's "Genesis Block", which created the first 50 bitcoins ever to be mined (by a quirk of Bitcoin's protocol these 50 bitcoins can never be spent).
4. With a brilliant leap of imagination, Satoshi had done what no one else had been able to do, and which many thought impossible. He had ingeniously incorporated @[adam3us](https://twitter.com/adam3us)'s Hashcash design as a way of securing transactions on a network not controlled by anyone.
5. By burning energy in search of digital needles-in-haystacks, Satoshi's proof-of-work design allowed, for the first time ever, scarcity to be brought to the digital realm:
![Vijay tweet](assets/images/cy19q1/vijay.png){: .align-center}
6. Since the creation of Bitcoin's genesis block on January 3rd, 2009 at 6:15pm (GMT), the Bitcoin network has seen the steady and remarkably reliable creation of blocks for a decade, allowing millions of people to store and transfer value without let or hindrance.
7. While many are obsessed with making price predictions about [#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin) in 2019, one thing we can actually predict with high certainty is that Bitcoin blocks will continue to be created approximately every 10 minutes with remarkable reliability.
8. As the Bitcoin network continues to function reliably well into the next decade, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.
9. Slowly but inexorably the world's population will come to recognize the benefit of opting out of the status quo monetary order and returning to a world of true individual financial sovereignty.
10. 10 years hence we will look back at the now 20 year old Genesis Block and recognize its creation as the beginning of a new monetary epoch.
With the tap of a key on his keyboard Satoshi set in motion a sequence of events that set our world financially free.

Addendum: If you're interested in learning more about the genesis block I highly recommend [the fantastic 2013 post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.msg1790805#msg1790805) by the brilliant @[SDLerner](https://twitter.com/SDLerner) .

# [Deconstructing Decentralized Exchanges](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/deconstructing-dex)
## The goal of this Essay is to explain the architectural structure of decentralized exchanges, and the performance and security tradeoffs associated with various architectural choices.
### By [Lindsay X. Lin](https://twitter.com/lindsayxlin?lang=en)

## Introduction

Decentralized exchanges are becoming a critical tool for purchasing and selling an increasing percentage of cryptocurrencies. The term "decentralized exchange" generally refers to distributed ledger protocols and applications that enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without the need to trust a centralized entity to be an intermediary for the trade or a custodian for their cryptocurrencies.

Decentralized exchanges provide a number of important benefits, including (1) lower counterparty risk (i.e., no need to trust a centralized exchange to secure and manage private keys), (2) the potential for lower transaction fees, and (3) a more diverse array of trading pairs that can unlock access to riskier or less liquid cryptocurrencies. As demand for these features increases, decentralized exchange technology may witness tremendous growth in usage, development, and adoption within the next couple of years.

Additionally, decentralized exchange usage is being fueled by concurrent regulatory and industry trends, including (1) a surge in the quantity of distinct cryptocurrencies that makes comprehensive listing impractical, (2) regulatory risks of listing cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges, and (3) users' desire to avoid centralized exchanges' Know-Your-Customer requirements for more private and less censorable transactions.

Decentralized exchanges can differ dramatically in terms of technology, trustlessness, security, legal implications, economic implications, and more. These differences render some exchanges more or less suitable for specific use cases. The goal of this Essay is to explain the architectural structure of decentralized exchanges, and the performance and security tradeoffs associated with various architectural choices. By understanding these technical differences, the reader will have a better grasp of which decentralized exchanges are optimized for which use cases.

## Architecture of a Decentralized Exchange

The term "decentralized exchange" is used colloquially to describe both blockchain-based exchange protocols, as well as applications that leverage the protocols. A decentralized exchange protocol generally describes a software program, hosted on or integrated into one or more distributed ledgers (e.g., Ethereum), that enables peer-to-peer transactions that are automatically settled on the distributed ledger. Users retain sole custody of their private keys throughout the transaction process.

A decentralized exchange application builds on top of a decentralized exchange protocol, and adds an on-chain or off-chain order book database and a graphic user interface (GUI) and/or APIs so that the information is easily accessible.

Overall, a decentralized exchange application can be broken down into the following components:

1. The blockchain platform & technical implementation
2. The counterparty discovery mechanism
3. The order matching algorithm
4. The transaction settlement protocol

A decentralized exchange application may not be fully decentralized in all four components. Note that for many decentralized exchange applications, one or more components may be off-chain/centralized, or otherwise feature economic incentives which would promote a tendency towards centralization.

We will discuss each of these components and provide examples of how some decentralized exchange protocols implement these components.

## 1. Platform & Technical Compatibility

Most decentralized exchange protocols generally operate with tokens that feature the same technical implementation and are on the same distributed ledger platform. For example, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and 0x are independent protocols that are operable only with standardized ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Beyond Ethereum, Stellar's decentralized exchange is operable with tokens issued on the Stellar network, and BitShares' OpenLedger DEX is operable only with tokens issued on the BitShares blockchain platform. Off-chain cryptocurrencies and assets could also be traded through the Stellar decentralized exchange or OpenLedger DEX if an "anchor" issues tokens onto the network that represent ownership of a defined unit of the off-chain cryptocurrency. However, this requires users to trust that the anchor has sufficient reserves of the off-chain cryptocurrency to satisfy all redemptions of the tokens.

A few decentralized exchanges are beginning to use atomic swaps to enable users to atomically trade cryptocurrencies that exist on different blockchain networks (e.g. exchanging Bitcoin for Dogecoin, cryptocurrencies from separate blockchains). However, atomic swaps still require that the transacted cryptocurrencies adhere to certain common technical standards. For example, in BarterDEX, a cross-chain decentralized exchange that enables users to transact cryptocurrencies from different blockchains, atomic swaps are only available for cryptocurrencies from blockchains that have implemented features that mirror the Bitcoin reference implementation, such as BIP65 (Check LockTime Verify) and other standard Bitcoin API methods. In practicality, this means that cryptocurrencies that were built off the Bitcoin reference implementation, such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, or cryptocurrencies that forked from Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, will be the easiest to make compatible for atomic swaps with Bitcoin.

Cross-chain swap technologies like PolkaDot and Cosmos are also building tools and protocols that could eventually be integrated into decentralized exchange applications that can atomically swap tokens from different blockchains. However, given the current latency of most cross-chain atomic swaps (with transaction confirmations dependent on the confirmation times of both cryptocurrencies' underlying blockchains), most popular decentralized exchange applications currently focus exclusively on token trading within one chain. As PolkaDot, Cosmos, and other interchain swap tools and protocols are refined and developed in conjunction with Lightning, Raiden, and other transaction performance-enhancing upgrades, some day users may enjoy liquid and low latency cross-chain decentralized exchanges.

## 2. Counterparty Discovery Mechanisms

Counterparty discovery mechanisms enable buyers to discover sellers who are willing to execute transactions on mutually acceptable terms. On traditional cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex, and Kraken, users have the option of submitting both market orders and limit orders, and these orders are automatically matched with unidentified counterparties using the exchange's central limit order book which aggregates all user orders.

Most decentralized exchanges also have order books. These order books may exist on-chain, hosted on a distributed ledger, or off-chain, hosted by third parties. Most decentralized order books display the separate orders of each counterparty, rather than the aggregated orders of all counterparties. Users normally will need to identify a particular order, and thus a particular counterparty, in order to trade.

Some decentralized exchanges do not have order books and instead feature a reserve-based model. A reserve provides a supply and demand of various tokens that are readily available to be executed based on the reserve's quoted buy and sell prices for that token. These reserves are created by on-chain smart contracts that enforce the trade execution and settlement process. The trade price may also be programmatically determined by a smart contract.

For the rest of this Essay, the term "Maker" will refer to the party that provides an order, and the term "Taker" will refer to the party that fills it.

##### _**On-chain order book**_

On-chain order books are hosted directly on the distributed ledger: all orders are submitted to the distributed ledger network and are confirmed by the network. Anyone can host and access a copy of the order book, and anyone may submit their own orders to be included in the order book as long as the distributed ledger is public.

Examples of on-chain order books include the Bitshares and Stellar decentralized exchanges. In the Stellar network, users submit orders which are hosted on a persistent and public on-chain order book in the Stellar distributed ledger. Information about this order book is broadcast to all Stellar validator nodes and is viewable by the public. When two orders intersect in price, the trade is automatically executed and settled by the Stellar network. The BitShares decentralized exchange operates under a similar model, but for the BitShares blockchain and network.

**Benefits:**

1. **Less censorable:** There is lower reliance on a centralized party to host and operate the order book. There may be a centralized GUI for the order book, but any independent party would be able to create separate GUIs and populate it with the on-chain data. Assuming that hosting and operating of the order book is distributed across independent, non-colluding validator nodes, there is no centralized point of attack, compromise, or liability that would result in the order book being shut down or specific orders being restricted by a centralized party.
2. **Less trust required:** Decentralized, on-chain order book hosting means that one does not need to trust centralized, off-chain actors to accurately and reliably publish or broadcast order books.

**Trade-offs:**

1. **Order book inherits performance, cost, and security characteristics of the underlying blockchain:** The speed and cost of submitting or removing an offer on an on-chain order book are limited by of the speed and cost of interacting with the underlying blockchain. Users must pay for each order book update on the network, wait for the network to reach consensus on their updates, and then wait for secure confirmation of the updates. If the blockchain is compromised by an attack, the order book may be compromised. Therefore, slower and higher fee blockchains are less favorable for hosting a user-friendly on-chain order book.
2. **Slower updates:** In the absence of second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network or Raiden Network, on-chain order books are generally updated based on the information contained in the latest block or ledger. This creates latency which could range from minutes to seconds depending on the platform. In contrast, off-chain order books can support almost-instantaneous updates given that most only need to alter a centralized database to reflect the update.
3. **Stale orders:** On-chain decentralized exchanges generally support resting orders, where the desired price and quantity have been fixed by the Maker upon creation of an offer. In a resting order, the offer must be proactively canceled by the Maker if she no longer wishes to trade on those terms if, for example, the price has changed dramatically. Since updates to on-chain order books can have delays due to the speed of transaction validations of the underlying network, on-chain order books could create an environment where resting orders are exploited when there is high price volatility. However, as usage of on-chain order books grows, we expect to see growth and adoption of trading tools (such as trading bots) to help users programmatically automate the submission and cancellation of order upon market price changes.

##### _**Off-chain order books**_

Off-chain order books are order books that are hosted by a centralized entity outside of a distributed ledger. The centralized entity helps parties discover other parties who make offers on the asset and can restrict access to view or submit to the order book.

The practicality of using an on-chain or off-chain order book depends significantly on the performance of the chain. Decentralized exchanges normally do not employ on-chain order books given that every order and adjustment to an on-chain order book would require an update to the blockchain, thereby incurring transaction fees and wait time. On certain chains, transaction fees are negligible and wait times are on the order of seconds. Under these circumstances, an on-chain order book is practical to use for moderate volumes of intermittent orders. Comparatively, on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees are non-negligible and wait times are on the order of minutes. Using an Ethereum on-chain order book would likely incur expensive transaction fees and debilitating wait times. For this reason, four of the most prominent decentralized exchanges in Ethereum—0x, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and IDEX—employ off-chain order books. As of October 2018, 0x, AirSwap, EtherDelta, and IDEX support ERC-20 tokens.

* In the 0x ecosystem, entities called "Relayers" host, manage, and publish off-chain order books. Makers will submit buy and sell orders directly to a Relayer, and the Relayer will aggregate all received orders into its order book. Takers discover Makers' orders by querying the Relayer's order books. Upon finding a suitable order, a Taker will fill the order by submitting information pursuant to the 0x protocol to the 0x exchange contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Given that all Relayers use the 0x protocol for settlement, a Relayer may choose to share its order books with other Relayers, thereby unlocking thicker order books and greater liquidity.
* On the AirSwap platform, a Maker will submit an "intent to trade" in a certain trading pair to an entity called the "Indexer." The Indexer will aggregate information about the Makers and their intents to trade. Takers who wish to trade in a certain trading pair will query the Indexer to discover the identities of suitable Makers, using the Indexer as a counterparty discovery mechanism. Once a Taker finds a suitable Maker, they will negotiate off-chain on the terms of the trade, potentially using the input of an off-chain "Oracle" that will suggest fair pricing for the trade. Once the Maker responds with an order that is satisfactory to the Taker, the Taker will submit the order to the Ethereum blockchain.
* On the EtherDelta web application, in order to make or fulfill an order, Makers and Takers will deposit tokens from their Ethereum wallet into EtherDelta's on-chain smart contract. Makers will submit orders to be publicly broadcast on the EtherDelta off-chain order book, and the order book will ping the blockchain to verify that the Maker has sufficient balance deposited in the smart contract to fulfill the order. Takers will then select an order and click "Buy" on the web application, causing the EtherDelta smart contract to perform the trade.
* On the IDEX web application, in order to make or fulfill an order, users will deposit tokens from their Ethereum wallet into an IDEX smart contract. Users then use the IDEX application interface to place buy and sell orders on an off-chain order book. IDEX and EtherDelta have similar structures in that they both integrate an off-chain order book with an on-chain smart contract for settlement, but IDEX adds on a "transaction processing arbiter" that helps to manage the order of pending trades so that trades are confirmed in the correct order. Therefore, as users trade, the IDEX application interface will update their displayed balances in real-time, but the on-chain settlement may occur with a delay given that transactions are queued. By controlling the order of transactions, IDEX separates trade execution from trade settlement, facilitating a smoother user experience.

There are both benefits and tradeoffs to having an off-chain order book.

**Benefits:**

* **Performance improvements:** Off-chain order books are better able to accommodate quick order turnover. Instead of waiting for a block to be mined and confirmed (or, alternatively, a ledger to be updated) to update the order book, off-chain services can update ledgers almost instantaneously.
* **Cost improvements:** There is no need to pay a transaction fee in order to submit or update an order.
* **Fewer blockchain-originated risks to the order book:** Given that the order books are hosted off-chain, the order books would not be vulnerable to blockchain-originated vulnerabilities such as 51% attacks (where users may reverse transactions) and front-running (where users may submit higher transaction fees for their offers to be included or updated faster than others').
* **Compatible with all ERC-20 tokens:** Any token that has the ERC-20 technical implementation can be traded on these decentralized exchange protocols. The token does not necessarily need to be approved, audited, or reviewed by anyone to be traded.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Higher degree of trust required:** Users must rely on the hosts of the off-chain order book to properly broadcast orders. These hosts could fail to accurately display and update orders, such that users would not be able to rely on them to discover counterparties. In the worst case scenario, these hosts could choose to arbitrarily censor valid orders or manipulate markets by strategically displaying inaccurate or outdated orders. Additionally, hackers could change the off-chain order book interface to manipulate users into sending cryptocurrency to the hackers' cryptocurrency accounts.
* **Greater restrictions:** As a centralized entity, the operator of the off-chain order book may be subject to greater legal and regulatory requirements, such as the implementation of Know-Your-Customer requirements, obtainment of requisite authorizations and licenses needed to trade cryptocurrencies classified as securities, and the implementation of rules and policies against market manipulation. While these requirements are helpful in preventing unlawful and abusive uses of the order book, these requirements may raise concerns about transaction privacy, open accessibility, and user experience.
* **Inaccurate order books:** Given that there is a mismatch in timing between a Maker's submission of an order and a Taker's fulfillment of an order, any given order displayed on an off-chain order book may be outdated by the time that the Taker wishes to fill the order. For example, the Maker may already have withdrawn the tokens that she wanted to trade, yet her order is still posted on a Relayer. Therefore, the Taker may attempt to fill an order by submitting a transaction to the blockchain, only to realize that the order is no longer valid. This could delay the Taker and consume significant amounts of transaction fees.

##### _**No (or hidden) order book: liquidity reserves**_

To solve the issue of low liquidity, some decentralized exchange protocols, such as KyberNetwork, Bancor, and Omega One build up and/or leverage liquidity reserves that are readily accessible when users wish to exchange tokens. The performance of these models depends on reserve depth/breadth and accurate pricing.

* In KyberNetwork, "Reserve Contributors" contribute tokens to build up "Reserves" of a variety of tokens. Each Reserve has a conversion rate for each trading pair, managed dynamically by a Reserve Manager. If a user wants to exchange token A for token B, she will send tokens to the KyberNetwork smart contract and the KyberNetwork will find her the most favorable rate, as determined by Reserve Managers. If such rate meets the user's pre-defined minimum requirements, the smart contract will send the corresponding amount of token B to the sender's pre-specified address. The user can view and approve the worst-case rate prior to sending any tokens.
* In Bancor, users can exchange tokens for other tokens through smart contracts called "Smart Tokens," which store reserves of ERC-20-compliant tokens and ether. To illustrate, users who wish to exchange token A for token B would need to find a Smart Token contract holding both tokens in reserve (i.e., Smart_Token_AB). The user would send token A to Smart_Token_AB, thereby buying some number of Smart_Token_AB tokens based on token A's formulaic price. Next, the user would send the Smart_Token_AB tokens to its smart contract, thereby destroying those tokens and pulling out a number of B token based on token B's formulaic price. Prices are programmatically determined through a formula that factors in the reserve supply of each token plus a constant reserve ratio.
* Omega One aims to aggregate liquidity across cryptocurrency exchanges by treating the entire centralized and decentralized exchange landscape as a potential reserve. Users who want to trade token A for token B will deposit token A in the Omega One's on-chain smart contract and submit an order to trade token B subject to timing and pricing limits. Omega One will then use its own centralized and decentralized exchange accounts to purchase token B and trade it with the user's token A in a swap via the smart contract.

**Benefits:**

* **Lower friction to trade:** The reserve model enables users to enter trades more easily given that the supply and demand sides (i.e., the reserve) have fixed terms and are readily available to trade upon those terms. This removes the potential friction involved in discovering counterparties and negotiating.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Requires trust in a smart contract or third party:** The model requires a party to trust in the security, accuracy, and fairness of the smart contract or third party that is performing the reserve and/or order fulfillment functions. Given that smart contracts are complex, difficult to audit, and may have unanticipated security vulnerabilities, users could lose funds if the smart contract is hacked or misbehaves. Models that rely on third parties to provide liquidity, such as KyberNetwork and Omega One, require users to trust these third parties to act reliably and fairly.
* **Uncertain pricing:** Given that there is high volatility in token prices, some models require users to trust a centralized party to provide fair and updated pricing. Meanwhile, models that rely on deterministic pricing algorithms could be easily exploited by arbitrageurs.
* **Tendency to favor large reserve contributors:** Reserve models that rely on users to fund reserves may incentivize larger reserve contributors to participate more than smaller reserve contributors since lower spreads on trades will require higher volume to be profitable. In that case, users may need to depend on the participation of large reserve contributors for liquidity, leading to more centralized control of reserve supply.
* **Reserves may be available and liquid only for the most popular tokens:** Tokens that are new or exotic may not have reserves available or may have insufficient reserves to fulfill trades based on a user's desired price and quantity. Only commonly traded tokens are likely to have deep, liquid reserves.

## 3. Matching Mechanisms

Matching is the process through which buy orders are paired with sell orders that have mutually acceptable terms. Decentralized exchanges may feature automatic matching or require Takers to manually identify and fill an order. Automatic matching occurs when a computer algorithm is used to pair and execute buy and sell orders. "Manual" order filling is the process through which Takers identify a resting order on the order book and actively perform actions to execute that particular order.

On centralized exchanges, all user orders are aggregated, and users are able to submit market orders and limit orders. A market order is a buy or sell order that is executed instantaneously based on the current market price, and a limit order is a buy or sell order where a user will specify a maximum purchase price or minimum sale price, and will only be matched with orders that offer a price that is at or more favorable than the specified price. Market orders allow users to obtain market price for their orders without having to specify a desired price, thereby increasing the speed and ease of trade, whereas limit orders allow users to obtain market price for their orders while protecting them from trades that are less favorable than a specified minimum or maximum price.

By comparison, most non-reserve-based decentralized exchange protocols do not have market orders or limit orders. These protocols often feature manual order filling whereby Makers will submit resting orders that specify a fixed price and volume, and Takers will fill these orders based on the Makers' specified terms. Therefore, if prices of the trading assets change significantly after a Maker places an order, and the Maker does not have an opportunity to correct the price, the order may get filled at a price that is less favorable to market price. However, developers of off-chain order books, user interface applications, and bots for these protocols can implement off-chain logic that mimics automatic order filling by allowing a user to specify desired parameters off-chain, and programmatically selecting the most favorable order that meets the user's specified parameters.

Reserve-based decentralized exchange protocols may feature automatic matching services that function similar to limit orders. Prior to execution, the user may query a smart contract or an off-chain party about the reserve's current exchange rate, and some protocols have built-in guarantees that the user will receive an exchange rate that is at least as favorable as a stated exchange rate or a user's specified exchange rate.

Analyzing a decentralized exchange's order matching algorithm is important because this will affect its ease of use, ability to provide fair exchange rates, and wait time between order creation and order fulfillment (i.e., the latency of order fulfillment). Moreover, the algorithm also informs the arbitrage opportunities that could arise from manipulating the prioritization and speed of matching through mechanisms such as front-running.

_Manual order filling_

With manual order filling, Takers must proactively find and accept a counterparty order. This mechanism introduces more latency into order filling, but generally requires less trust and provides users more control given that users do not have to rely on a centralized or smart contract-based matching algorithm.

For example, in 0x, Takers discover Makers' orders via Relayers. If a Taker wishes to accept an order, she will submit a counterorder to the Relayer and digitally sign and send the completed transaction to an on-chain smart contract that will settle the transaction. If a Maker's orders are not actively monitored, Takers could exploit stale orders upon changes in the fair market price of the underlying token. However, off-chain bots and services could help the Maker programmatically manage its orders based on market price fluctuations.

In AirSwap, users can query Indexers to find addresses of counterparties. Users must negotiate with counterparties privately to reach agreement on transaction terms and fulfill an order. This mechanism helps to protect Makers from losing money on stale orders (e.g., orders that are not reflective of current price movements).

On EtherDelta, Makers will post resting orders onto the order book, specifying a desired price and quantity for a trade. A Taker must manually select a Maker's order from the order book and submit the order on the web application. Even if there are buy and sell orders that intersect on their desired terms, EtherDelta will not automatically match and execute these orders. The absence of an automatic order matching creates more latency and friction, given that Takers must manually identify suitable trades. However, no central party is needed to fairly and reliably match orders.

_Automated order filling_

With automated order filling, an algorithm will match orders automatically. Automated order filling reduces the amount of user time and effort needed to identify suitable trades, thereby reducing order filling latency. However, this approach requires users to trust the matching mechanism to execute securely and provide them a favorable price.

Decentralized exchanges employing liquidity reserves have automated order filling. In KyberNetwork, Reserve Managers feed dynamic exchange rates into the KyberNetwork smart contract and orders are filled at the current exchange rate. In Bancor, orders are fulfilled automatically based on a deterministic pricing formula built into the smart contract. In Omega One, orders are fulfilled automatically based on the best rate found across multiple exchanges.

IDEX is a non-reserve-based decentralized exchange that employs automated order filling. On IDEX, users may submit limit and market orders because the application has built-in off-chain order matching algorithm that helps match orders on the off-chain order book. The user will be matched with the most favorable order that is available on the order books, provided that it is more favorable than the user's stated baseline price. This off-chain matching logic significantly improves the user experience; at the same time, users must trust IDEX's order matching algorithm to fairly and reliably match orders.

On the Stellar decentralized exchange protocol, users may also submit limit orders to the on-chain order book. The Stellar decentralized exchange has an on-chain order matching algorithm that matches orders based on a first-in-price, first-in-time principle: orders are automatically filled such that, when an acceptable counterorder is found, the earliest submitted order made will be filled. The on-chain order matching algorithm is built into the Stellar network protocol, meaning that there is no need to trust a centralized party to perform the order matching.

## 4. Transaction Settlement

All decentralized exchanges feature on-chain settlement. On-chain settlement is a necessary element that enables users to eliminate the need to trust a centralized party (such as a centralized exchange) to control user assets, settle trades, and ensure that account balances are correct. On-chain settlement helps users publicly verify on the ledger that their trades were settled according to their desired terms.

The performance of any decentralized exchange is limited, at the very minimum, by the latency involved in securely confirming a transaction on the underlying chain. Therefore, the speed of confirming a transaction in a distributed ledger network is the bottleneck for decentralized exchanges.

Some distributed ledgers feature significantly higher latency than others. A secure settlement confirmation on the Bitcoin network may take hours, whereas a secure confirmation on Ethereum generally takes minutes under current limitations. Confirmations on certain more recent platforms can require a few seconds. Therefore, the final settlement time would depend heavily on the confirmation latency of the underlying chain.

## Different Exchanges, Different Use Cases

Each decentralized exchange presents a different array of latency, security, liquidity, privacy, interoperability, and trust tradeoffs. Therefore, different exchanges will excel in different use cases and requirements.

### Access

First and foremost, different decentralized exchanges offer access to different cryptocurrencies.

Many cryptocurrencies issued in 2017 and 2018 are ERC-20 tokens; in order to purchase these tokens, one must use an decentralized exchange protocol that is compatible with the ERC-20 technical standard, such as 0x or IDEX. Similarly, as some new ICOs are held on competing platforms such as Stellar and Waves, one may be pushed to use their respective decentralized exchanges to transact tokens issued on those platforms.

### Security

With respect to the technical security of Ethereum smart contract-based exchange protocols, the smart contract driving the exchange protocol may be vulnerable to accidents and security vulnerabilities. The degree to which a smart contract will function as intended and will not be vulnerable to exploits remains somewhat uncertain given the difficulty of thoroughly auditing Ethereum's Turing-complete smart contracts. By contrast, distributed ledgers with on-chain native decentralized exchange functionality should in theory have significantly lower attack surface given that protocols are more thoroughly audited and require network consensus to change and exploit.

The security of a decentralized exchange is limited also to the security of the underlying distributed ledger. For example, if a proof of work blockchain is attacked, such as through a "51 percent" attack, settled transactions may be reversed despite a large number of block confirmations. Under any consensus mechanism, the network's validator nodes could also collude to "fork" to an alternate state of transactions (and orders, in the case of an on-chain order book), adopt a technical standard that is incompatible to the decentralized exchange protocol, censor (i.e. ignore) orders submitted by certain addresses, modify order settlement, matching, and reserve smart contracts, and more. Therefore, the ultimate security of a decentralized exchange is dependent on the security of the underlying distributed ledger.

Transactions that require strong security conditions should be settled using thoroughly audited smart contracts and distributed ledger platforms with a consistent history of guaranteed functionality.

### Liquidity

Many new cryptocurrencies may only be available for purchase or sale through decentralized exchanges, given that centralized exchanges have been slow to list new tokens due to regulatory risk. Therefore, many cryptocurrencies may only be attainable and tradable over decentralized exchanges. However, a decentralized exchange would not be practically useful for users if it did not have robust order books or other mechanisms that enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without significant price slippage.

The use of interoperable decentralized exchange protocols enable applications that use the same protocol to be able to pool together liquidity for "networked liquidity." For example, Relayers built on 0x may pool together their order books to build a thicker order book. Any token issued on the Stellar platform can be exchanged with any other token issued on Stellar, generating a network-wide order book. While liquidity on decentralized exchanges is currently significantly lower than on popular centralized exchanges, interoperable protocols will hopefully spur greater networked liquidity.

### Latency

The latency of a decentralized exchange depends on the speed of the underlying distributed ledger. For example, if it takes 3 minutes to confirm one transaction in Ethereum, then an order would be settled in 3 minutes at a minimum given that the ultimate settlement of a trade must be on-chain. This latency will likely improve as the Ethereum network adopts new technologies to increase throughput and lower validation time.

Some distributed ledger networks permit significantly faster on-chain settlements due to the use of different consensus mechanisms. For example, an order or settlement on Stellar can be securely confirmed in 5 seconds due to the speed of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The on-chain order books on Stellar would be slower to update than the off-chain order books on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, but third parties could eventually develop off-chain order books for the Stellar decentralized exchange, as well.

Even the lowest latency decentralized exchanges currently cannot compete with the near-instantaneous settlement speeds of centralized exchanges. For users who engage in high-frequency trading activities, centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Pro, Bittrex, Kraken, and Poloniex may still be the best choice, given that market orders can potentially be placed and settled in seconds. Moreover, until the stable release of cross-chain atomic swaps, centralized exchanges are still the best platforms for trades swapping tokens that were issued across multiple chains.

### Cost

The cost of using a decentralized exchange application includes the costs of (1) fees to the decentralized exchange application, (2) fees of making and/or taking orders, (3) fees involved in interacting with any smart contracts enabling the decentralized exchange protocol, and (4) fees involved in settling a transaction to the distributed ledger. These costs may include blockchain network transaction costs (e.g. using ETH for transaction fees for settling a transaction on the Ethereum) or fees for using a certain protocol (e.g. paying ZRX tokens to 0x Relayers for trading fees). Settlement on some blockchains may cost more than a settlement on others.

Whereas centralized exchanges tend to charge fees that are a percentage of the total transaction size, the cost of using a decentralized exchange tends to be fixed per transaction: a high-value transaction would incur the same fees as a microtransaction. Therefore, those who are submitting high-value transactions may save transaction fees by using a decentralized exchange.

### Trust Level

Different decentralized exchange applications require different levels of user trust. Users may need to trust: (1) the decentralized exchange application creator and operator to perform activities such as hosting and publishing order books or performing order matching, (2) the underlying decentralized exchange protocol, including relevant smart contracts, and (3) the security, miners, and validators of the underlying distributed ledger. Users must trust each part of the exchange application stack to perform its job fairly, reliably, and securely. If any part of the stack fails, users may be unable to reliably and securely submit and fill orders, match with orders that meet their specified criteria, and confirm the settlement of trades. Moreover, users may find that trusted parties could censor some of their transactions or act in a self-interested manner to the users' detriment.

Some users may want to minimize trust in the decentralized exchange application layer: therefore, they would want to minimize reliance on the application to host and publish order books and/or perform order matching. Therefore, these users may choose applications that have on-chain order books. They may also choose applications that do not have automatic order matching.

Some users may want to minimize trust in the decentralized exchange protocol by making sure that the protocol has a minimal attack surface. These users may choose to only interface with highly audited protocols such as 0x protocol, or an on-chain, difficult-to-modify protocol such as the Stellar protocol.

Lastly, some users may want to minimize trust in the security, miners, and validators of the underlying distributed ledger. Different users will have different opinions on which distributed ledgers have the most favorable, trust-minimized characteristics; factors such as the ledger's security and exploits history, audit history, consensus mechanism, governance mechanisms, and distribution of miners and nodes could all contribute to this calculus.

Practically speaking, many users may not be overly concerned about trusting decentralized exchanges given that users do not relinquish control over their private keys. Ultimately, most users may prefer a better user experience rather than optimizing for trust minimization. Users must decide on the level of trust that is necessary for their personal use cases for a decentralized exchange.

## Conclusion

The term "decentralized exchange" encompasses diverse applications and protocols that differ in architecture, but all enable users to transact cryptocurrencies without relinquishing control over their private keys to an intermediary.

Decentralized exchanges are still in an early development stage; their higher trade latency, lower liquidity, and less intuitive user interfaces make them less attractive for mainstream retail users. However, as centralized exchanges continue to experience security exploits and delay the listing of new cryptocurrencies, more users will elect to adopt decentralized exchanges despite their high friction. It is worthwhile to invest in the development and growth of the decentralized exchange ecosystem to promote liquidity in an increasingly diverse token ecosystem, greater user control of cryptocurrencies, more privacy features, and lower risk of censorship.
