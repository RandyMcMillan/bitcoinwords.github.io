[![February 2020 Journal Cover](/assets/images/covers/CY20M2-cover-150.png "February 2020 Journal Cover")](https://paywall.link/to/2020M2){: .align-left} *WORDS* is a monthly journal of Bitcoin commentary. For the uninitiated, getting up to speed on Bitcoin can seem daunting. Content is scattered across the internet, in some cases behind paywalls, and content has been lost forever. Thatâ€™s why we made this journal, to preserve and further the understanding of Bitcoin.
