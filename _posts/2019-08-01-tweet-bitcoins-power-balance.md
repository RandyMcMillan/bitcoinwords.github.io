Happy UASF day*

*nothing actually happened on this day in 2017 but it was decreed as Segwit lock in day so we’re going to celebrate it anyway

UASF is the most important event in bitcoin’s history (in my opinion) and it is absolutely critical to understand bitcoins “governance” (call it what you will)

I modeled bitcoin's power balance like this after the event, I'm fairly pleased at how it has held up.
