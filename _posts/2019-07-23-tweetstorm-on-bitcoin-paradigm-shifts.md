1/ paradigm shifts seem to be a big topic these days.

there are two important ones happening right here and right now, which have been *proven* possible by bitcoin.

digitization and disintermediation.

a very short thread...

2/ today, the realm of digitally native assets is worth nearly nothing. digitization is largely taking existing (often physical) assets and transposing them to a new medium.

bitcoin is a digitally native asset that is backed by its own scarcity and the demand for it.

3/ historically, digitization requires *more* reliance on intermediaries, not less. 

my colleague [@RyanRadloff](https://twitter.com/RyanRadloff) wrote a brilliant analysis on intermediaries and their role in digitization - [medium.com/coinshares/bitâ€¦](https://medium.com/coinshares/bitcoin-has-a-branding-problem-its-evolution-not-revolution-aa34fe5facfb)

4/ bitcoin breaks that trend. it requires no trust in an intermediary.

unlike most "digital" assets, bitcoin requires no intermediaries. some may *choose* intermediaries, but bitcoin requires no such thing.

it took me a long time to process how profound of a change that is.

5/ and that leads us to a second paradigm shift - disintermediation.

in the short term, people may opt to use intermediaries to access bitcoin (as they do today.) longer term, a new behavior will emerge - one that is a *revolution* and makes the asset independent.

6/ trust has long been the grease that drives the grinding gears of capitalism.

but trust in markets, in economies, in institutions - is at an all time low. and for good reason.

a world without trust necessitates a new model. 

this [@cryptograffiti](https://twitter.com/cryptograffiti) piece ðŸ‘‡ captures it nicely:

7/ this new model doesn't materialize overnight. 

our psychological anchoring keeps us rooted in the world of the physical, and the idea that intermediaries protect us from risk. 

[@eiaine](https://twitter.com/eiaine) captures this brilliantly. change is coming. slowly at first, then suddenly and at once.
