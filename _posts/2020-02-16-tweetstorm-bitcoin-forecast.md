My #Bitcoin Forecast

RocketBitcoin $100K within 5 years

Based on a conservative estimate of Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Value, it is likely that $BTC will ùü≠ùü¨ùó´ within the next 5 years.

A thread forecasting Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term price using Energy Value.

**Approach**

Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Value has tracked Bitcoin‚Äôs price for the last 10 years.

Let‚Äôs use it to forecast price.

There are only two varying inputs in Energy Value:
High voltage signHash Rate 
GearMining Hardware efficiency

We can forecast each of these to predict BTC's Price.

**Hash Rate**

Over the last 5yrs, Bitcoin‚Äôs HR has grown exponentially (linear on a log scale).

Assuming this relationship holds, but allowing for some market saturation, we can estimate that the HR growth rate drops from ~135% p.a. today to ~20% p.a. in 2025.

**Mining Hardware Efficiency**

Energy efficiency has also improved exponentially. 

But the annual rate of improvement has fallen from over 400% in 2015 to 50% last year.

I expect this trend of declining improvement will continue.

**The Forecast**

Combining these estimates for HR and Efficiency, Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Value should reach $ùü≠ùü¨ùü¨ùóû by 2025.

* Sanity check: $100K Bitcoin = 1.8T market cap.
* That's just 20% Gold‚Äôs market cap 

**Mr. Market**

So far, we have only looked at fair value. 

As always, price fluctuates around value.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Price has deviated to as low as -70% discount to Energy Value, to as high as a +600% premium.

If this cycle repeats, BTC could see prices as high as $600K+.

**2X Fair Value?**

While 6X fair value is a possibility, excessive swings will become more difficult with time due to the law of large numbers. 

For the coming market cycle, I expect 2X fair value is definitely within the realm of possible.

Where will this money come from?

Supply Falling:

* 40% of BTC is locked in wallets that have not moved their coin in >2 yrs.
* Bitcoin Inflation rate to halve in May & again in 4 years. 

BTC will be the lowest inflation asset ever known to man

Note: HODL Wave patternEyes

Demand growing:
* @Glassnode number of entities ATH
* New onramps: VAR management now possible w/ options. Prev. Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility blocked access to institutions
* Bitcoin up 100% in 2019, yet no growth in Google searches
* Number of 1+ BTC addresses ATH
* It's a QE hedge

**What about electricity?**

BTC uses ~0.3% of global elec.

With continued improvements in Energy Efficiency, $100K BTC will likely consume just 3X current energy.

A BTC market cap of $1.8T - 8T (=gold) could consume less than 1.5% of the world‚Äôs power.

**Note 1**

Because the HR forecast is below the historic trendline, and the efficiency forecast is above the trendline, both forecasts can be considered historically conservative.

--> $100K Energy Value is conservative.

**Note 2**

The ASIC chips caused a step-change improvement in Energy Efficiency in 2013/14, dropping Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Value.

Should such an event occur again in the next 5 years (eg. Quantum computing), this would cause a 1-for-1 drop in predicted Energy Value.

**Note 3**

Perhaps the 2 most critical risks to Bitcoin's future are:
* Quantum Computing: breaking SHA-256 algorithm / accessing lost coins
* Government outlaw: while decreasing with time, major economic outlawing of BTC would curtail mass adoption and Energy Value

**Conclusion**

This forecast should be considered a ‚Äúbase case‚Äù.
All forecasts are wrong, some are useful.

I expect Bitcoin will hit at least $100,000 within 5yrs.

Based on historic BTC fundamentals, growth rates and market cycles this is a conservative estimate.

**Final Thoughts**

Risks considered, Bitcoin is an attractive investment.

Each generation has a "once in a lifetime" opportunity. 

Bitcoin was the best performing asset of the last 10yrs. 

There are plenty of reasons to think the next 5 will be no different.
